## The Badger-Two Medicine Wilderness

During the Summers, I had no work because school was out, I would don my backpack and wander into the Badger-Two Medicine wilderness. I always sought the view from the next ridge and cherishing my solitude. While I thought about David frequently, I did not, as I feared I would, fall in love with him. We were good buddies with benefits. I longed for the a time when I would have an actual lover, to have the mutual physical intimacy and company everyday. I seriously doubted it would ever happen.

They even skipped environmental impact statement required by Federal Law. Needless to say, a controversy erupted as many organizations took umbrage starting protests and lawsuits. Their actions didn't bother the Feds, though, they opened the gates to let the companies in to start exploring and road building. 

This was literally my backyard. A ten minute walk from my cabin and I was on that very BLM land. I had explored this place since I came to this area two years ago. 

One of my favorite hikes from my cabin involved traversing some soggy wetlands the domains of a significant beaver population. Following the...
