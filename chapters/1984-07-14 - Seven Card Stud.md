## The Iron Horse

## Morning
Chris comes over and wants to get fucked.  Conflict, because Vince isn't there. Is Vince's permission required, or it just polite to ensure he knows.  Chris tried to convince me, I decline. Chris leaves, but  brought me a folded piece of paper. I unfolded it recognizing Vince’s handwriting and signature . The text: "Fuck him so he’ll shut up."

Watching the 10am arrival of the Bastards for their mid summer meeting.  


## Afternoon

Riding with the Bastards

## Evening

Partying with the Bastards, the Foresters begin arriving.

## Dealing until 2AM

The Foresters are a rough crowd. 

The fight between Grizz and Dragsaw of the Foresters
