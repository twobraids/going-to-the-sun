##  Late Morning - East Glacier, Montana

I stepped out from under the wooden awning over the sidewalk at the grocery store facing US2. Crowded with cars and Glacier Park tourists. It was a rotten day to have chosen to go to the grocery store, Saturday at noon on Labor Day weekend. One of the few days of the year when I wished there were a traffic light at US2 and Two Medicine Road. Cars clogged the highway all the way down to the bridge over Midvale Creek. 

The Ironhead Sportster waited by the curb.  With practiced ease, I arranged my groceries in the saddle bags so that their lids would latch. I mounted, kicked it into neutral, and started the engine. Seizing an unexpected opportunity, a U-turn directly from my parking space won me a clear shot onto the westbound lane of US2. 

Passing through the troublesome intersection, I prepared to accelerate out of town, but I spotted a bike at the gas station on the left: a big bagger Harley. Holy shit—Ted's Tour Glide. I hadn't seen him since that night at the Iron Horse.

I swung the bike onto the shoulder, waited for the tourist traffic behind me, pulled a second U-turn, and rolled in behind Ted. He recognized me the moment he saw me. 

"Karl! Well, for heaven's sake, Karl. How have you been? I haven't seen you since July."

"I'm doing great. Check out this bike."

Ted hung the nozzle back on the pump. He stepped over to get a look. "An Ironhead Sportster. That's perfect. When did you get it?"

"I made a lot of money this summer. I got it in July. I'm a dealer at Iron Horse now."

"No shittin'? I guess I'm not surprised; you're good with cards." Ted walked around to the back of the bike where, in my rearview mirror, I saw his smile crash. With an incredulous look, he pointed at the Bitterroot Bastards patch on my back. 

"Karl! Where did you find that?!" 

The side stand scraped on the concrete as I dismounted to face him.

He sounded like a school teacher dressing down a misbehaving student. "You can't just wear something like that. Those are dangerous men. You can't wear their patch. If they see it, they’ll come after you."

I smiled. "They gave it to me."

"Who gave it to you?"

"Vince handed it to me. The Bastards met at the bar in August. They voted in four new guys as prospects. I'm one of 'em."

His mouth gaped and his brow knitted. "Karl. Why would you do that?"

"They saved my ass. Last July in the bar, that was my last hundred-fifty bucks. Yeah, I made some cash that night, but it’s not a living. I'd be sleeping in my car by winter if they hadn't hired me on."

"Son, you understand what they are?"

"Yeah, I know a lot about them. I'm not in yet, I'm probationary. It's not the full patch."

"And you went through with it anyway, knowing about them?"

"Ted, I made my choice. It's not changing."

He shook his head. "Oh, Karl. This is not good." He turned his face away from me as if he needed to think how to respond. "I gotta go pay for my gas." 

He gestured to the Two Medicine Tavern across the side street. "Listen, David is waiting for me over at the bar. Meet me over there."

I nodded and remounted the bike. As Ted walked over to the station attendant to pay, I eased over to the gravel parking in front of the tavern with its touristy wild west façade. I pulled next to David's Wide Glide, dismounted, and waited for Ted. It took only a couple of minutes for him to finish his business, coast over, and park next to me.

"David's in there. He's not expecting to see you. You two got a hatchet to bury. He's still sore about that night at the poker table." Ted put his hand on my shoulder. "But, Karl, stow the patch. David's not ready to see that. Dunno how he’d feel about it, but, for sure, it’s not gonna to help. Don't even mention it to him. Some other time.”

I frowned.

He looked over to the bar entrance and then back to me. "Karl, you and I have to talk about this Bitterroot Bastards thing. I don't want you getting in over your head. Sometime when David's not around." He waited for me to remove the patched overlay and stash it in my saddle bag, already crowded with groceries. 

Echoing in my head, Vince's voice, "You’re on this bike, you’re wearing the patch. Always."

Ted pushed through the door, and I followed. Crowded. Noisy. Lunchtime tourists. David sat at the bar, facing away from the door. 

Ted raised his voice over the crowd noise as he stepped up to David. "Look what I found outside."

David turned, his eyes locked onto me. I expected a change in expression, but it didn't happen. He said nothing.

"Howdy, David." By unvoiced mutual agreement, we didn't even offer to shake hands. 

A young girl, the waitress, stepped up and said, "I have a table for you now. Will you be ordering food?"

"Nope. Just drinks, I'll pick 'em up here." Ted turned to the bar and spoke to the bartender. 

David followed the waitress to a table near the back wall next to the jukebox. I followed. A guy wearing cowboy boots and hat alongside his similarly attired girlfriend stepped away from the old machine as it pulled a 45 from its bank of vinyl records. "He Stopped Loving Her Today," by George Jones, started the set. 

Having to sit this close to the speakers really annoyed me.

David and I sat across from each other. He stayed silent. We sat there for a few moments, looking at each other as George Jones sang a slow, mournful ballad of heartbreak.

Why would anyone put this song on a jukebox, let alone somebody actually selecting it? 

I finally spoke up over the funeral dirge. "Jesus, country music is always so cheerful."

That got a twitch of a grin from David, but it didn't last. He still said nothing. Ted stepped up, dealing drinks to the table. He set a beer in front of David, ginger ale to me, and then sat with his own beer. 

Ted tried to spark the conversation. "David, you have to see Karl's new ride." That got more of a reaction from David. He looked to me for more information.

"Well, it's not new. It's a '76 Ironhead Sportster." 

"How'd you get that?" The first words that David said to me.

"I made a lot of money in the last month."

"How? I thought your teaching gig ended." David barked it like a challenge.

I thought for a second about how to tell David about getting the bike without mentioning the Bastards. It's their bike. I glanced at Ted, but his expression gave me no advice.

"I'm a dealer at the Iron Horse in Columbia Falls now." I watched David's face for a reaction—still deadpan. 

Ted stepped in again, "The bike's got a great custom-painted tank. Metallic brown flake base, and airbrushed yellow and orange flames. Somebody did a hell of a job on it. The fenders match. It's artwork."

"Ed did it." I thought in my head without saying it out loud. 

The music changed. "Livin’ on the road, my friend. Was gonna keep you free and clean…", Willie Nelson singing Pancho and Lefty. 

I had heard the song before, but never paid any attention to the lyrics. Sitting next to the jukebox made them all too clear. The opening line "Livin' on the road" summoned my fantasy of living on a bike, riding with a buddy, every day a new adventure. I shook off the distraction, recentering myself at the table.

"I'll take a look at the tank when we get out of here." David looked annoyed. "God, I hate this song."

Ted smiled, cocking his head slightly as if to hear it a bit better. "Really? Oh, I love it. Willie sings it really well—great old west kinda tune."

I slipped right back into my reverie, imagining what it would be like to ride with David like that. Just out on the road, camping every night, no destination in mind.

"The dust that Pancho bit down South. Ended up in Lefty’s mouth…"

The words hung in the air in front of me. That’s what this was. David kicks me in the dirt, and I swallow it, just like I swallow his loads. 

Why am I so fucking hot for this guy?

Again, I shook myself out of my thoughts. Both Ted and David looked at me as if waiting for me to answer a question that I hadn't heard.

Figuring he needed to repeat himself, Ted asked, "So what do you think of bike? How's the ride?"

"It's a really fun bike. Top-heavy compared to the Honda. I've gotten used to it. I love the low-throated power of it."

Ted grinned at me. "Yeah, it's the perfect first Harley for you."

"I rode it with Vince and Chris about a month ago..." I sighed as I realized I had just brought up the Bastards that Ted warned me against. Hell. Rolled on the throttle and aimed at David. "They'd never ridden the curves of 49. They loved it. Vince suggested I get one of those new Kawasaki Ninjas to really ride the curves." I awaited his reaction.

"Oh, fuck off on that Jap shit. You wanna ride a fucking wind-up plastic toy bike?" David spat the words. 

There it was, that dust in my mouth again.

Ted interrupted, trying to change the subject. He turned to me. "So where were you riding today?"

I moved my eyes to Ted, but kept my face aimed at David. "Just a grocery run. I spotted you at the gas station as I pointed back home. Where you guys going'?"

Ted answered and I turned toward him. "We’re just makin’ a big ol’ loop. David’s headin’ down our place in Augusta, meetin’ up with Bill and Larry—we’re makin’ plans for an elk hunt this October. Got a holiday barbecue party goin’ this afternoon. You’re welcome to join us for dinner tonight if you wanna ride on down with us. Maggie makes a killer potato salad."

"I was just gonna lay low for the holiday weekend." My desire to get into the wind with them overwhelmed my judgement. I really wanted to ride this bike with David, my ticket to squeezing some respect from him. "Sure, I won't say no to a ride and a dinner." 

"Great, Maggie'll love to see you."

Willie Nelson wound the song down, "Pancho needs your prayers it's true, But save a few for Lefty too, He only did what he had to do..."

David let go with a heavy sigh with his eyes looking away from the table. He turned back to me with resigned disapproval. 

Ted eyed David for a second and then turned back to me. "You an elk hunter?"

"Nah. I've never hunted. My father never did either."

"You wanna get started?"

"Not really. I like seeing the wildlife, not killing them. But I'm not so wound up about it I'll refuse to eat hunted meat. I'm just not  interested in doing it myself."

"Fair enough. If everyone hunted, there wouldn't even be elk anymore."

David abruptly stood up. "Enough yapping. Let's get on the highway." 

Ted followed and I lagged behind.

David had pushed through both the crowd and the exit door before I finished thanking Ted for the drink. 

Outside, I found David kneeling in the gravel examining the Ironhead. 

"Jesus Karl, it looks brand new, but it's a '76."

I wondered how he'd react if I told him that it’s a loaner from the Bitterroot Bastards. A guy in prison used to own it. I frowned and kept up the lie. "Uh, yeah, I got it from a collector. It had only three hundred miles on it."

"Huh. Probably some poser owned it and he scared himself with it. How much did you pay for it?"

I really wanted to casually say, "my life." Instead, I answered, "I paid what it was worth to me."

"You're not saying, 'cause ya know you got screwed." He smirked at me.

I just waved my hand at him, dismissing his question. 

David focused in on the bike's tank. "Yeah, this is a sweet paint job. Somebody spent some real time airbrushing it." To my utter surprise, David handed me the payoff. "This is a good bike. I'm glad you're off the Honda. Now maybe we can do some real rides."

"The other rides were fake?" He never even heard me. He had practically jumped onto his bike and started it.

I looked over to Ted. He had been getting on his bike while David and I talked. Ted started his bike. I was the one behind in the game. I pulled my dark glasses down off the top of my bandana, mounted, and started it. 

By the time I pushed back from the curb, David had already assigned himself point and sat, feet down on the asphalt, waiting for us to line up behind him. 

Ted pulled in and I followed up the rear, just like last time.

## Early Afternoon - I-15 Southbound

David set a fast pace for us. It was an utter joy. We passed every vehicle we encountered, all the while with this rumbling engine between my legs. No denying it, the curves, the shifting up and down, the rip of a quick acceleration gave me a hard-on. Riding like this is erotic. We chewed up the asphalt all the way to I-15 in Shelby. I couldn't stop smiling.

In Shelby, we pulled into a gas station. It was an old-style station with what obviously used to be a pair of garage bays to the left of the office. The bays had been converted into a convenience store. 

Cars suckled at all six pumps—no place to pull in. Ted surprised me by pulling up to the side door of the building. David parked next to him.

I rolled up beside Ted—killed my engine. "What's up? What are we doing here?"

Ted answered. "This is my northernmost gas station. One of the four I got spread between here and Great Falls. I'm checkin' up on them. Seein' how they're doing on the holiday weekend."

I nodded, remembering how he had said something about that last July when he gave me free gas at his station in Augusta.

David and I sat on our bikes with Ted's between us for about fifteen minutes. David and I did not exchange a single word. He didn't even look at me. I watched him take a draw on his flask and stash it back in his breast pocket.

My stomach growled. I hadn't had lunch before I committed myself to this ride. Since David wasn't talking, I dismounted and walked over to the convenience store. I bought a few sticks of jerky. I stashed all but one in my jacket pocket, tore open the remaining one.

I sat back on my bike, gnawing the jerky. 

Ten minutes later, Ted came back out the side door smiling. "I think we're gonna set a record this weekend. They're doin' great. Let's move on."

David started his engine immediately. I followed suit. Within a couple minutes, we hit the on-ramp to I-15 southbound. I thought we'd been going fast on US2, but on the freeway, David set the pace at eighty. A full twenty-five miles per hour over the absurd fifty-five-mile-per-hour speed limit. Totally exhilarating. 

This freeway is pretty straight, with a few curves that were clearly engineered for faster speeds. Prior to the 1974 nationwide mandate of a fifty-five-mile-per-hour speed limit, Montana had no speed limit: safe and prudent was the rule. The state hated the federal speed mandate and refused to enforce it. Yeah, they still gave out tickets, but it wasn't for speeding, it was for wasting natural resources and therefore not a moving violation. The penalty was five dollars, could be paid directly to the officer, and had no effect on driving records. 

Even at eighty miles per hour, we passed a highway patrol officer, and he didn't flinch. They rarely ever pulled over motorcycles.

We next rolled into the town of Conrad. Again, we pulled into one of Ted's stations. This time, David got off his bike, stepped around Ted's bike, and approached me.

"Listen, if you’re ridin’ sweep, you damn well better know how. When point throws a signal to pass, you move. We don’t slither around traffic like a damn snake."

"Whaddaya mean?"

"Lane changes go back to front. You see my signal, sweep moves first. You own that left lane till we’re all in. Every bike ahead takes their cue from you. Your job’s to keep pricks like that Nebraska clown from cuttin’ through and bustin’ us up."

"I didn't know that. Thank you for telling me." I thought back to my rides with Vince and Chris. I remember Chris doing that exact move. He always moved over first, and only then did Vince move over.

"Not so important when there's only three of us, but if you ever ride with a big group, you need to know how it works."

About fifteen minutes later, Ted came out wearing a big smile. His businesses clearly were having a good weekend.

We continued south, eventually turning off the freeway at MT200 in Vaughn at the last of Ted's freeway stations. This was my turn to get gas. As Ted promised in July, I got the gas for free. 

From there, we had only a forty-five-minute ride to Ted's house. 

## Augusta, Montana

We rolled into Augusta in the late afternoon. We turned onto an unpaved side street, took a left and I recognized Ted's house near the end of the block. Unlike last time, pickup trucks and cars crowded the edge of the road where the curbs would be if this town had curbs. Ted pulled left into his driveway where his tow truck sat and rolled straight into his garage.

David pulled up to the garage threshold and parked. I rode only to the middle of the driveway. As had become my habit, I reoriented my bike to point outward. My exit would require no turning around. 

Heavy sigh.

This wasn't just a meet-up of a couple of their buddies; this was a full-blown neighborhood party. Neither what I expected nor what I wanted. A bunch of people I didn’t know and didn’t likely want to talk to. I just wanted to eat and get back on the highway.

A bunch of kids raced around from the backyard to see the bikes that had just arrived. A few guys wearing cowboy hats, teenagers, followed along. 

Maggie came through the garage from the backyard. She and Ted hugged. After lingering for a moment, Ted led her out front where David and I were still stripping off our jackets. 

David laid his jacket over the bike seat as Maggie approached him. It looked like Maggie intended to hug him, but he didn't reciprocate the intent. Instead, they shared an awkward moment plastered over with a perfunctory but polite greeting. David wasn't in a good mood, I suspected he hadn't anticipated the community party either.

Stepping away from David, Maggie focused on me. She stepped up enthusiastically, and I got the hug she intended for David. 

"Karl, it's so nice to see you again." She smiled broadly.

"Nice to see you again, too, Maggie. I've made good use of the leathers this summer. I'm so grateful for them."

"Oh, I'm so glad. Hey, I wanted to thank you for that call you gave me when you guys got separated in July. It really set Ted's mind at ease." She still held that smile.

"Well, it seemed like the right thing to do. I didn't want anyone worrying." 

"You are so sweet. When he told me about you dealing at the Ox in Missoula, I remembered you. You dealt me a straight flush—best pot I ever won."

I laughed. "I really miss dealing stud. Everyone wants hold 'em these days."

Her head turned to the Ironhead. "This isn't same bike you had before, is it?"

"I got this bike just a few days after the ride in July."

"That paint job is just stunning." She leaned in and traced the lines with her finger. "Look at that detail." 

Just then, Ted approached with an Olympia beer in a longneck bottle. "Isn't that beautiful work, Maggie?"

He held the bottle out to me.

I hesitated.

"Don't worry, I remembered. It's your special brew."

I took the bottle and smiled.  "Thank you."

"Let's go outback and get you introduced."

I turned to Maggie. "Ted bragged about your potato salad. I haven't eaten since breakfast. I need to eat."

Maggie lit up her smile again. "Oh, we've got it all set up. C'mon back."

I followed them through the garage and into the large quarter-acre backyard. The back side of a commercial garage sat at the other end of the lot facing the highway. Ted's got a great setup here with his work just on the other side of the yard. Four old cars sat lined up along the east fence. Couldn't tell what they were, covered in dust and weeds growing up around them, they obviously hadn’t moved in years.

About forty people milled around—adults in lawn chairs, kids darting through the crowd, teens standing in cliques. In my first thirty seconds there, two different mothers scolded their kids for being too noisy or running into people. Kids—instantly annoying.

The teenage boys noticed me first. I stood out—a joker in a fifty-two-card deck. Soon, more heads turned. People leaned in to whisper. Jesus, I didn’t even have the patch on and they looked me at like I’m selling drugs to their kids. 

I focused on the long folding tables spread with food. It looked like the potlucks from the Lutheran church of my childhood: salads, hot dishes, beans and bacon, salads with chicken—no vegetarians in this crowd. 

Three charcoal barbecues, briquettes still burning in pyramids, sat by the side fence. Several men hovered near them, looking proudly in charge of the meat.

I looked to Ted. "I assumed you'd be the barbecue chef today."

"Oh, no. This isn't even my party. I just offered my yard for it."

"Why?"

"We don't have dogs. Only backyard in town not full of dog shit." Ted startled me with his outburst of too-loud laughter. I'd forgotten that.

I grinned, flashing to a couple backyard parties in my past where you had to watch where you stepped. 

Another memory drifted into my mind: Missy, an old university buddy's dog at a backyard party. She snagged a raw T-bone practically from under his spatula. She managed to hide the whole thing in her mouth as she slunk away. He caught her, pried the steak from her mouth, and put it on the grill anyway. 

Maggie handed me a paper plate. "We're still an hour away from the meat being ready. This one's my potato salad." She dug out an overly generous spoonful and put it on my plate. 

"Thank you." I walked along the table, made a few selections: baked beans and a tuna noodle hot dish—skipped the Jell-O and the fruit salad made from mostly marshmallows and canned fruit.

After filling my plate, I turned to look for a place to sit. I didn't see anything, so I settled in cross-legged on the ground next to the fence, mostly away from the people. I scanned the crowd and noticed that several of the teenagers still had their eyes on me. I ignored them.

With my acute hunger, it took me only a few minutes to finish my plate. Maggie's potato salad did not disappoint, but she gave me way too much of it. 

Ted swooped in as I tossed my plate, eager to play host. He dragged me through a blur of handshakes—ranchers, feed store guys, irrigation guy, the bar owner, and the church minister—all met me with cold eyes.

Ted introduced me as a poker dealer—yeah, that’ll endear them to me.

Nobody offered small talk. No smiles, no feigned interest.  Only Ted acted comfortable with me. Church crowd —no hope for me here—I dismissed even trying.

After having struck out with most of the crowd, Ted led me to a pair of guys deep in conversation with David—ranch hands in their thirties from the look of them. I admired their lean frames and the tanned skin one only gets from a summer working outdoors. They looked like brothers—maybe even twins.

David just scowled at me, I frowned back at him.

They were Bill and Larry, the hunting buddies Ted had spoken of earlier. Their handshakes nearly crushed my fingers. Nice enough guys, but they talked endlessly about hunting and the firearms that they used. I nodded in silence while listening, but I had nothing to add and no interest in trying to fake it. 

I slowly drifted from their conversation, longing to get back out on the highway.

With my faux beer now empty, I wandered over to the coolers to see what else there was to drink.

I skipped the beer coolers and focused on soft drinks. As I reached for a Shasta Cream Soda, I found myself surrounded by chattering teenage girls. Trying to step away, I backed right into one of them. 

I turned to her. "Sorry—"

"Karen, Karen." I heard the stern voice from a middle-aged guy with a spatula near the grill—one of the guys from the feed store. "Get away from him." 

Feeling like the ball in a pinball machine, I extricated myself from the girls, avoided the men at the grills, and found myself facing a group of women in chairs looking at me.  Maggie stood up and started her round of introductions, identifying each woman by name and husband's name. There were no single women.

There was no place for me to sit but I felt awkward just standing there in front of them like an exhibit. 

After her introductions, Maggie launched into the second-hand tale of my poker table performance at the Iron Horse in July. She told a good story, but I didn't recognize myself in it. 

Some of the women loved it, others looked uncomfortable, and the minister's wife looked scandalized. Her knitted brow glared disapproval. As if she felt obligated to add a moral to Maggie’s story, she said, "Gambling is a sin."

That certainly put me in my place. I felt some camaraderie with Maggie; we both got put down. Though, I nearly laughed at Maggie’s theatrical eye roll as her reply.

Church people.

Ted, still watching over me, stepped up as my rescuer. "Karl, have you seen my garage? C'mon back, I'll show you."

Grateful for the out, I followed him. We'd only gotten ten yards from the party when this lanky kid, maybe seventeen, stalked up and blocked me. His cowboy boots once had been fancy, but they looked scuffed to hell like he’d kicked dirt more often than he rode a horse. 

 "You just stay the hell away from her.” He raised his fists, but his eyes kept darting to the side, like he expected someone to cheer him on. ”Don’t want you goin’ near her again. She’s my girl." 

Holy shit. I stopped and looked at him in confusion. His faded Great Falls Rodeo t-shirt, too big for his frame, likely hand-me-down from an older sibling. “What? Stay away from who?” 

I glanced at Ted. He looked like he was about to laugh.

“Karen’s my girl. I—I saw you touch her. She don’t want nothin’ to do with you. You stay away, or I’ll—I’ll teach you a lesson you won’t forget.” His arm shook, but it looked more like fear than proper anger.

I noticed some other teens behind him over by the fence watching the kid. They smirked like they'd just won a bet. No doubt in my mind, this kid in front of me had just been goaded into playing tough guy.

Ted let out a long breath and stepped between the kid and me. "Darren, don’t be dumb. Karl isn’t after Karen. You really think he’s gonna toss her on the back of his bike and ride off?"

Darren hesitated, fists still up. I saw the jaw muscle of his hairless chin twitch.

Ted pointed back to the grills. "Darren. Go get yourself a hotdog. Karen isn’t even watching you; she's talking with Daniel."

Darren turned to look, his shoulders slumped in dismay as he spotted the girl I assumed was Karen in close conversation with some other guy. He gave a whimper, dropping his fists, abandoning his bravado, and rushing off toward her.

Ted turned to me. "Christ. You’ve been here for an hour, and the whole town—" He shook his head, interrupting himself.  "Let’s get to the garage before everyone in town decides you’re a threat to their daughters' virginity."

We walked on. I looked at the cars parked by the fence. A couple Buicks, one with tail fins, one of those El Camino sedans with a truck bed, and, what I thought was the gem of the collection, a '69 Thunderbird that somebody had rear ended. 

We stepped up to the back door of the garage and walked in. There were three bays, two with lifts. The shelves, work benches, and tool cases that lined the walls reflected Ted's army background—everything meticulously in order. An old fashioned Texaco Star logo hung on the rear wall. 

"Karl, I'm really sorry about all that. A lot of those folks are the church goers—not very tolerant. I didn't think they'd give you such a cold shoulder."

"Yeah, the church people, I know what you mean."

"Well, honestly, you've seen a garage before, I didn't bring you here to see it. I wanted to talk before you head back north."

"You wanna to talk about the Bastards."

"Listen, I know you said your decision about the club isn’t changing, I just want to understand why.”

The I saw the concern in his eyes. Ted was a good man, but shit, I didn't want to go there. I looked at the floor, and then back up at him and nodded. It felt like I was about to have a lecture from my father.

He pulled a pair of shop stools from under a bench.

Ted sat down across from me. He leaned forward, locking eyes with me. “So tell me about the motorcycle club. How are they pulling you in? What's in it for you?” 

I sat silent for a minute. How can I say this without outing anyone? I let the silence stretch for thinking time. 

“I’ve never fit in anywhere. I’m always an outsider. I mean, look what's happening here today.” I paused, struggling to explain myself. “I met the guys at the bar and they understood me immediately. They took the time to get to know me. They actually listened to me. Then they opened a space to fit me. It’s more than protection. It’s like I’ve found my people.”

Ted’s brow creased. “You know they got into serious trouble back in the day.”

“Missoula. ‘76. Yeah, I know. This is a different club chapter.  The members in the Flathead valley broke off, made their own group in ‘75. Didn't want any part of the drug dealing."

Ted blinked a couple times. "Well no, I didn't know that."

"Vince gave me the history.  He's been with club since the fifties. Said they his chapter has kept to the original charter."

“Remind me, who is Vince?”

“Owns the bar in Columbia Falls. He’s the Bitterroot Bastards President.” I couldn't keep my eyes on Ted, I started staring at a grease spot on the floor.

After a moment of thinking he said, “The big guy with the Boss shirt behind the bar. Don’t think I ever met him." He paused again and sighed. "Listen, I rode with the Bastards a couple times in ’75. Didn’t patch in.”

That stopped me. I dragged my eyes up from the floor. “You did?”

"After 'Nam', I retired, moved here. I missed the camaraderie of the army. Looking for noise, I guess. But something felt off with the Bastards. I bailed.”

“Then maybe you understand.”

“Well, no. Wasn’t anything like what you said. They demanded loyalty up front.” He paused. “I just don’t want to see you get hurt.”

“Ted… I’m in trouble. Doesn’t matter what I do.”

"Of course, it matters—"

"No, it makes no difference. I could go to prison anytime—I'm a walking felony."

He blinked. “Jesus, Karl. What did you do?”

“I’m not going to talk about it. Just know this—there was no victim. No person, no corporation, no government. Just me. Being who I am is a felony in Montana.”

Ted stared at me, saying nothing. His jaw moved like he might speak, but nothing came out. His eyes flicked up, away from mine, then back again—searching—striving to understand.

After a moment, I saw it come to him. He drew back just a fraction, an instant of surprise, his mouth opened a second time, but again, he hesitated. He took in a breath. "You never even looked at that girl." 

Yep, he got it. I stood up off the stool. My voice calm. “I appreciate your concern Ted. Thank you for all you and Maggie have done for me. I hope we can still be friends."

He didn’t answer right away, but standing up with a furrowed brow of concern, he said, "The Bastards, if they knew—"

I maintained my straight face. "They know. They offered their loyalty and protection up front, not the other way around."

A moment of confusion spread across his face. Again he struggled with what to say.

"Ted, it's ok. I'm only doing what I have to do."

"Oh, Karl, you ever need help—any kind—don’t be afraid to ask.”

I gave him a nod. “Thanks.”

He held his hand out to me. I looked at it and up to his face. With our eyes locked, I reached out for the biker handshake.

I stepped back toward the door. "I want to get back on the highway, I'm still two hours away from home."

Ted grabbed a business card off the bench and handed it to me. "I know you got no phone, but this is my number anyway. Call me."

"Thank you, Ted." I stepped out the back, ready get the fuck out of this place.

By the time we got back to the party, everyone was eating. The grills churned out burgers, hotdogs, brats, and chicken. Still a bit hungry, I picked out a burger, dressed it with somebody's home canned pickles—the preacher's wife? I ate standing by the fence by myself, ignoring everyone.

After I finished, I noticed David standing alone near the doorway into the garage looking right at me. Once he was sure he had my attention, he gave a subtle nod toward the door. I caught his meaning. I gave a slight nod, he got the message right away. He turned, went through the doorway.

I scanned around looking for Ted. Finally spotted him near the line of coolers consolidating the beer bottles into one. 

"Hey Ted, David and I are going to get pointed north."

"Yeah, I understand. I so glad we ran into you today. Sorry about this party. I'll come out with you."

We walked toward the garage doorway when Ted took a quick detour. "Maggie, David and Karl are heading out."

She stood up and joined us walking through the garage. As she caught up to me, she put her hand on my arm. "Karl, dear, I’m heartsick things didn’t go smoother this afternoon. People ‘round here take forever to warm up to new folks—their loss, not yours. You’re always welcome at our table, no question. And don’t sweat it—we're not part of Diane’s church."

She gave me a hug as David mounted his bike behind us. Ted shook my hand again. 

David started his bike, revving a couple times echoing his impatience.

I mounted mine and started it. Before we cruised out, children ran around the side of the house to see. 

David rumbled out to the road. 

I followed. In my mirror I caught a glimpse of that kid, Darren, standing at the garage door with his hands in his pockets, watching us, looking sullen.

Back on the main road, we accelerated to highway speed synchronously, same clutch/shift/throttle-roll. I banked on our ripping duet of Harley pipes setting the minister's wife's teeth on edge.

## The Cabin at Heart Butte

We rode fast and hard for the next eighty minutes. The wind whipped every thought out of my head—just an animal sprinting across the landscape, body in tune with the terrain. My dick got hard.

I followed David up the road to his cabin. It appeared much as it did last time I was here, except for all the tired, dusty undergrowth already on its way to winter dormancy. September is not summer here; winter always holds the trump card. We had our first frost just a couple of days back.

David got off his bike and turned to me. "Give me a blow job."

I smirked—exactly what I wanted. I hadn't sucked him off since July. After two months of sex with Vince and Chris, I felt like a journeyman mastering a new trade. Chris in particular showed me techniques that blew my mind. All that tension between David and me today just fueled my fire. I wanted to take him for a ride.

"Gimme a minute." I unbraided my beard. I wanted the whole freak flag flying. I finger-brushed my beard as I stepped up to him. 

It started like every other blow job. This time, he just leaned back on his bike with his hard dick sticking out of his leather riding pants. I knelt on the ground, feeling the engine's radiating heat and hearing the ticking of the cooling metal—I needed to watch where I put my hands.

I started slowly. First, I licked up the shaft of his dick. With each stroke, I lingered a moment on the back side of his dickhead. 

After several repeats, I tightened my lips, licking them to serve as lube. I pushed his dickhead slowly through my tightened lips. I stopped advancing down as my tongue flickered around on the back side of his dickhead.

David groaned and began to twitch his hips. I pushed my head down just a little bit further and stopped again, right at the smooth skin of the shaft behind the head. David gasped. With one hand, I reached into his pants and hooked his balls out. Tightening my hand around his scrotum but leaving his balls hanging, I tugged slightly, making David squirm. 

Holding him in stasis, I grabbed my beard, twisted it into a rope, wound it around his cock, and slowly pulled my head up while tightening my lips. My coiled beard unfurled from his balls, while the tight drawstring of my lips rode up over his glans, and my tongue continued darting around his dickhead.

Then I pushed my head down all the way to the hilt, opening my throat as Chris taught me. David's entire body convulsed as he bucked his hips. The bike rocked. I split my beard in two and wrapped each in opposite directions around his cock, yanking it tight with a crude knot. Now bound to his crotch, he couldn't pull out.

I continued the exquisite torture for twenty minutes before he  took some initiative of his own. 

He stood up. My beard unraveled, releasing him. He shivered with the sensation. He grabbed my hair roughly on either side of my head and shoved his cock into my mouth. With force, he started fucking my face. He sped up, slowed down, and sped up again.

As they taught me, I matched his rhythm, then started to change the phase. Instead of unison, I countered his motions. This allowed me to control him, a head trip for me. He may be fucking my face, but I can control how deep he goes and, ultimately, when he cums.

It really is just like riding the bike through curves. The body flexes and balances the rhythm of the movement. It's the same thing everywhere: skiing, music, programming, and life itself. All one, like it exclaims on the Bronners soap bottle. 

I brought him to the edge of cumming several times before dampening him down by countering his thrusts using what the physicists call destructive interference of wave motion. He'd resist, but I held a tight control.

His strained voice called out from above me, "How are you doing this?" 

I strained my eyes looking up at him without disconnecting.  He looked down at me—dreamy, unfocused eyes—sweat running down his temples—the taste of his precum.

I pulled my mouth off of him and replaced it with long strokes of my left hand. "You wanna cum?"

He nodded as if words failed him.

I grabbed a handful of my beard in my right hand and then seized his balls, clamping them in a blanket of my wiry whiskers. I used my left hand as an extension tube for my mouth. With more surface area, my strokes and mouth worked together. I brought him close once and then backed off. Then I increased the speed and shoved him over the cliff.

"Jesus fucking Christ!"

His balls pulled up again against my restraining right hand. I resisted but ultimately let them pull up where they wanted to go. I felt the first hot squirt deep in the back of my mouth. He dragged the flavor onto my tongue as he pulled back and then pushed into his second spasm. 

Experience told me that his dickhead gets hypersensitive after the first couple of squirts, so I backed off with my mouth and finished him with my left hand. Great clots of his load landed in my beard.

He collapsed back onto his bike, his mouth open and panting. "Holy shit." He opened his eyes—took them a moment to focus on me. "How... how'd you do that?"

I just smiled at him. My own lust electrified my body and I needed to cum, too. I wasn’t going to get that from David. 

"It's getting dark. I gotta hit the highway, I don't want to have to dodge the deer."

David shook his head, trying to come to his senses. He pulled his dick back into his pants and zipped up. He stood up and pulled his wallet from his back pocket. He held out a twenty-dollar bill to me. 

"Thank you. We're going to negotiate a new rate next time."  I plucked it from his hand and turned to leave, then I heard him speak from behind me.

"Next weekend. Let's ride."  

I looked back over my shoulder. "Usual time and place."

He nodded. Then his face twisted—like he was dragging himself out of the afterglow just to get mad, like I’d stolen his initiative. 

Maybe that was just me hoping he’d feel it.

I walked over to my bike, opened the left saddlebag. I pulled out my Bitterroot Bastards overlay and put it on in full view of David standing at the door. 

I mounted the bike and went through the startup routine. Looking at him in my rearview mirror, I couldn't tell how he reacted to the patch. 

Maybe he didn't even see it. 

I descended his road and onto the highway with a Cheshire Cat grin. With the first rip of the engine, my beard flew up, slapping me in the face with David's drying cum wads—I should have rebraided it. I took my left hand off the handlebar, grabbed my flailing beard, and stuffed it down my t-shirt. Returning my hand to the clutch, I made the last shift to fourth. 

This time, the voice came in the wind. "The dust that Pancho bit down South. Ended up in Lefty’s mouth…" I laughed, rolling on the throttle, leaning into the curve, and wearing David's cum load like a badge of honor.
