### East Glacier, Montana

 While reading a science fiction book in a very uncomfortable chair in the laundromat, the sound of my washer suddenly changed. I stood up as it was the signal for the end of the spin cycle and time to snag a dryer.  I grabbed my basket, and started to pull my wet clothes from the washer. I knew immediately that something had gone wrong. My clothes all came out of the washer tinted reddish brown.  I held up a formerly white sock in dismay. 

"Oh, no," a voice behind me. "You didn't use the rust remover."

"Rust remover?" I questioned, having never heard of such a laundry product. 

"The water here is very bad in Winter. Iron in the water. It's clear in summer, but in winter you must use iron remover."

"What is iron remover?"

She answered by showing me a powder box.  I started looking for some snappily dressed sparkle toothed television host to jump out from behind a washer accompanied by "Rust Out" theme music—a made for television moment in a dingy poorly equipped laundromat on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation.

This was how I met Rose Lucsia, perhaps the kindest most thoughtful woman that ever passed through my life. She was Blackfeet tribe member married to a white man, Tom Lucsia, a heavy equipment operator for the Montana Department of Highways. He drove snow plows and other equipment over Marias Pass on US-2.

I did my laundry every couple weeks at that laundromat. Almost every time I went, Rose was there too. At first, I thought she must be employed there, but I was wrong. 

I never did figure out who owned or maintained the place. There was a clip board near the door where one could alert the owners of problems. I never once saw anyone cleaning or repairing anything in there.

I habitually did laundry every two weeks on Wednesday morning. I wondered if Rose synchronized her schedule to mine for our long conversations. I stopped bringing a book with me because our conversations were so engaging.  Rose had lived her whole life in the East Glacier and Browning areas. She had lots to say about the tribal government, the Park Service and the Highway Department. She could be remarkably blunt when there was something she disapproved of or felt was wrong. She told stories from her childhood and even shared some of the traditional stories of her tribe. When telling a story, she had a cadence, a compelling rhythm to her speech. I always wanted to learn to speak that way, but I never came close to it. She was a font of information about interesting places to hike in the area, too. She frequently foraged for native foods.

One time, in the laundromat, she asked me about my earring, "Why do you wear a woman's earring? Those are made to sell to tourist women at the Park Visitor Center."

Suddenly clamming up, I did not answer.

Sensing my discomfort, she said, "Oh no, it's not a bad thing. There are better earrings to wear, prettier ones," then she dropped the bombshell question, "You are gay?"

My eyes widened—can't deny the truth.

She continued, "In the Piikani language the word is, ááwowáakii. This is honorable, special, a good thing, not shameful. For white men, it is hard. I'll make you a better earring, one more worthy."

And she did. Next time we met at the laundromat, she brought a bag containing a beautifully beaded, brightly colored earring accented with a blue feather and bright yellow feather. I thanked her for the gift and donned it immediately. I really liked it. 

By the time we saw each other again, it was late spring. With the spring runoff, the water of the laundromat cleared and we didn't have to use Rust Out anymore. In our conversation, she invited me to their home near Heart Butte. Because it was a long drive, she invited me to share dinner with them and to stay the night.

I turned to Rose and said, "and you're sure you're ok with this?"

Rose said, "The Lord did not make mistakes in how he made people. We need to honor what He gave us. If you can help make Tom happy with the Lord's gifts, then it is God's glory fulfilled."

A novel view of Christianity that I had not encountered.
