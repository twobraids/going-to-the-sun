## Missoula, Montana

"Stop that fucking noise!" Nathan lay in his bed with the palms of his hands over his ears. He woke abruptly in utter confusion. The room, brightly lit through the open curtains, seemed all wrong. The noise pounding in his head, a heartbeat, should have shattered the windows. With a wave of vertigo threatening him, he sat up and realized he had his clothes on. They reeked of sweat, cigarette smoke, and, was it, puke? 

The clock read that it was the afternoon, and he had no idea how he got there.

Panic. He hadn't gotten breakfast for Dad. He leapt from the bed. Nearly crashing into the door frame, and ran down the hall toward the kitchen. Then the thought struck like an axe splitting firewood: Dad's dead. Abruptly stopping, he turned and walked back down the hall into Dad's room. It was a mess; the bedclothes were all pulled to one side. Parallel wheel tracks from the gurney rutted that old shag carpet that his Mom had installed when Nathan was still in high school.

Grief crested over his pounding head, pushing him down hard to the floor. The throbbing hurt too much to cry, but the tears would not stop. It took nearly twenty minutes for him to regain composure.

Rising back to his feet, he padded back down the hall, around to the kitchen, and drew a glass of water from the sink. He downed the entire thing without pause and drew a second. Suddenly aware of the urgency, he set the glass down and moved quickly to the bathroom for a long piss: the stinking dark yellow urine of the dehydrated.

Returning to the front room, relieved, he noticed a shiny folder on the coffee table. As he approached, it resolved into a bucolic meadow scene of wildflowers and the words "Garden City Funeral Home" in a fancy script. He stared for a moment as if it were an intruder in the house, then picked it up and opened it. The first page tucked into the right side was titled, "What do I do now?"  Tears welled in his eyes again. The folder fell back to the table.

Another ten minutes of struggling to control grief delayed finding aspirin for the hangover headache. As he shook a pair of tablets from the bottle, the enormity of yesterday replayed through his mind. Wait, was it yesterday? What day is this? 

Suddenly concerned he could not trust his own sense of time, he struggled to recall the day of the week. An idea sent him to the front door to fetch the Daily Missoulian. There were two of them on the porch. Had he lost an entire day? Checking the dates, it seemed today was Thursday, but did Dad die on Tuesday or Wednesday? Did he just neglect to fetch yesterday’s paper in the distraction of the mortuary van taking Dad away?

After a couple of minutes of confusion, he let it go as a unsolvable puzzle. He tossed the newspapers onto the kitchen counter, knocking his keys and a piece of paper to the floor. He fetched the keys, pocketing them, but ignored the paper.

He started to review his memory. Where were the holes?  He remembered driving aimlessly around town. Sometime in the day, he stood on the bridge overlooking the mill where he and his father had worked.  There was this weird memory of flying over slickrock canyons and driving insanely fast in some big city. There were buildings imploding. Wait, that was the movie, that beautiful tragic movie. There was that shaggy guy on a mountain bike - he looked like biker, not a bicyclist. His name was Kirk?  Kent? He recalled the walk into the canyon, and then the guy getting really mad at him. But, weren't they  together at the Oxford?

He started coffee brewing and filled a bowl with cereal. Only after filling his mug did he realize he brewed enough for his father, too.

He sat down on the living room couch and pulled out the "What do I do now" paper. It was a list of steps on who to notify and what phone calls to make.  He resigned himself to spending the rest of the afternoon with obligations. He put the paper down, and went back outside to sit on the porch to drink it in the warming afternoon sun. The calls would wait until he felt a little more human.

There were no relatives to call. Dad's brother, Luke, was killed in the war. Dad's sister, his Aunt Delores, died when Nathan was in grade school. That was it. Nathan had never known cousins, and his mother's side of the family was a complete blank.

His first call was to Kathy. He left a terse message on her answering machine. She was at work at the university.

Then he contacted the family attorney. He remembered the name of the firm, Laugsson something and something, because they had helped when his mother died and then again last year when his dad lost his career. As it was nearly three in the afternoon now, they promised to call him back in the morning with the details of the estate and schedule a meeting.

He called the funeral home, giving them some details they needed to complete their work. He called the bank.

Finally, he started to call Dad's friends. He fetched Dad’s address book from next to the telephone. He ticketed them off one by one as he completed the calls: Dad's poker club buddies, his former work friends, and then the neighbors.

The flowers started arriving by 4:30. 

Unexpectedly, at half past five, the doorbell rang, and Margret Craighead stood at the door with a tuna casserole for Nathan. She was the wife of the acclaimed grizzly bear researcher that lived just down the road. She expressed her and her husband’s condolences. She apologized that her husband, John, was up in Alaska. She asked if the funeral date had been set. She said that John would likely fly back down for the funeral, if he could give her the information with enough time. John and Nathan's father elk hunted together in the fall every year since they became neighbors two decades ago.

Kathy showed up forty minutes later after she got off work as a librarian at the university. She also brought a meal.  Meeting him at the door, she immediately launched into a hug, but then drew back suddenly. 

"Nathan, you're a mess. You need to change your clothes. You've got dried vomit all over your shirt. You reek."

Kathy, a friend since high school, excelled in caretaking. They never dated, though Nathan suspected back in the high school days that she had harbored such hopes. She always volunteered for the practical arts of living: cooking, sewing, and gardening. For years, she made Sunday dinner for Nathan and his father. In the first few years, Dad kept saying that they ought to get married. He even prodded her about it. However, their relationship had always been platonic; she had become somewhere between Nathan's sister and surrogate mother.

When she stepped into the house, she immediately started working straightening things up, starting with ensuring the proffered mourning meals were properly stored in the refrigerator. 

She collected the bouquets and arranged them on the dining room and living room coffee tables. She got the dirty dishes into the dishwasher and emptied the coffee pot. She picked up a piece of paper on the kitchen floor, read it, and put it back on the countertop.

"Have you cleaned up your father's room?"

"Umm, no,” Nathan said, seemingly overwhelmed by Kathy’s whirlwind.

She bustled down the hall and into his father's room. First, opening the curtains for light, then she assessed the bed sheets. She started stripping them off before Nathan even got to the doorway. "We're just going to have to throw the sheets away. They will never come clean. Get me a garbage bag."

Nathan turned back around to obey.

“Take a shower and change your clothes," she shouted from behind him.

Nathan felt unexpected relief and calm with Kathy’s skill at taking charge. He did not have to make decisions, just do as he was told. Women are so strong, he thought. 

He stripped in his room and kicked his dirty clothes into a corner. He crossed the hallway into the bathroom and realized Kathy had already started the hot water flowing for him. After bathing and redressing, he stepped back into the hall and almost collided with Kathy carrying the garbage bag he neglected to fetch. “Bring your dirty things to the laundry,“ she said.

It went on like that for the next hour. 

"Thank you, Kathy. I'm kind of paralyzed."

"I see that," she said. “Your T-shirt is on backwards."

 "I left after they took Dad's body away. I couldn't stay in the house. I wandered all over town all day long. I went down Blue Mountain Road and sat for a while at the place that we used to launch our tubes on the Bitterroot River when we were kids."

Kathy smiled at the reference. “And after that?"

I think I drove all the way out to Big Flat Road and sat and watched the IdaMont Pulp Mill from the west side of the river.

"That's a really random thing to do. Maybe that's why your clothes stank so much; that place is putrid."

"I came back into town over  Harpers Bridge and Mullan Road. I went downtown and parked, wandered around there. I spent a long time standing on the Orange Street bridge looking at the mill. I wanted to see it burn down. I wanted to burn it down."

"I can understand your sentiment. That new company is evil. Did you abandon thoughts of revenge?"

Nathan smiled, probably the first one of the day. "Maybe." 

"Who is Karl?"

"Karl?", the guy on the bike, yes, that was his name.  "How do you know about Karl?"

"That paper on the counter. There’s just the name and a phone number. It’s not your handwriting."

"Oh, God, he must have driven me home," he said in revelation. "I was afraid I had driven myself drunk."

"So, who is he?"

"I met him at the movie. He got me high, and we talked and walked down that new trail into Hellgate Canyon." Nathan stood up and went to the counter, picking up the paper.

"What movie?"

"I don't remember the name. There were all these scenes of the world dying."

"That war movie, Full Metal Jacket?"

"No, no, it was literally nothing but music and scenes; amazing scenes of mountains, deserts, clouds, oceans. Then it changed, and it was all mining and factories and despair."

"Must have been at the Crystal. You hate art films." She fetched the newspaper from the trash and sorted through it to find the movie section. "Koyaanisqatsi - wow, that was a hell of a movie to see on the day of your dad died."

Nathan stood with his mouth agape, "That's exactly what that guy Karl said. I remember, I remember."

"He and I talked and talked for a couple of hours. Though I think I talked way more than he did. I think I insulted him and he got really mad at me."

"What did you say?"

"He told me he was gay. I guess I really don't know what that means. He doesn't look like a homo. He looks like a biker, except on a bicycle. I remember my dad getting all worked up about the gays molesting children."

"Oh, Nathan, you didn't say that, did you?"

"Yes, and he got really mad at me."

"Oh, Nathan. That's a right-wing fantasy. They always scapegoat some disadvantaged group to distract people from what they’re really doing. I'm not surprised your dad believed it, but it's not true."

"After he yelled at me, he gave me an ultimatum: walk away, attack him with a baseball bat, or shut up.  I chose to shut up. I felt awful for my question. I'm surprised he didn't walk away, but he came with me to the Ox."

"You went to the Oxford? You really aimed low. That’s lower than the Stockman’s”

"He bought the first shot and toasted to my father. I asked him about the baseball bat thing, and he said, 'that is the way we die.' I don't think I'll ever forget his matter-of-fact tone, like he just didn’t care, like he expected it. After that, everything fell apart, and I don't remember much after that. I think he tried to convince me to stop drinking, but I'm not sure.  Then I woke up on my bed."

"I really want to hear his side of this story. You going to call him?"

"No, no, I'm not calling anybody more today. At least not tonight."

Kathy shrugged and said, "I'm going to sit here with you until 10 or so. I have to be at work by eight tomorrow morning. You want to go somewhere for a walk? Watch television? It’s St. Elsewhere night.”

"No, this road is terrible for walking. There’s no shoulder.  I don't want to drive anywhere. Shit, did I puke in the truck?" Nathan said standing up.

"Well, we'd better check. It's been sitting in the sun all day. Best to clean it up now rather than tomorrow. St. Elsewhere is just a summer rerun anyway.”
