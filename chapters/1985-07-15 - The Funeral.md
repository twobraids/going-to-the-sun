The day of the funeral was another day of blur for Nathan. It took place at St. Paul's Lutheran with about seventy-five people attending. Since Nathan had no living relatives anymore, Kathy sat with him. Nathan was not a religious man, and he was completely unfamiliar with his father's church. They had only occasionally attended another Lutheran church while his mother was alive and he was a child. His dad started attending this one regularly after she died. 

This church had a particularly powerful organ, the moment it started playing a set of long, low chords, Nathan startled. His mind leapt back to that movie with the complicated name he had seen the day his father had died.

Kathy saw his jerk and looked at him questioningly. Nathan shook his head at her. It wasn't the same music at all, but he suddenly felt haunted. 

Rather than a coffin at the front of the nave, an urn stood on a table draped with elegant green cloth. A triangular folded US flag sat next to the urn. His father had chosen cremation. Rather than burial, he wanted his ashes spread in the mountains of his happiest hours. He had been a hunter and loved the autumn hunting season above all others. Nathan envisioned a backpacking trip into the Sapphire Mountains in September to spread the ashes. 

Before the service began, Nathan took several discreet looks behind him to see who was there. He spotted several members of the Polleys family, a bunch of folks from the mill, the Craigheads, the Stocksteds, the Laugssons, some of the other neighbors, and a number of his friends. Some of Nathan's friends were also clustered together in some of the pews further back.  Looking to the other side, he saw someone he wasn't sure he recognized: long hair in two neat  braids, a long beard. Nathan leaned to Kathy and said, “Do you know the guy all the way back on the left?"

Kathy, less a slave to discretion, just turned to look. On turning back, she said, "no idea."

"I think it's that guy, Karl."

"Did you ever call him?" she whispered.

"No," he whispered. Then the service started with a hymn forestalling any further conversation. The congregation stood and began to sing.

It was not a long ceremony. As the service came to an end, a uniformed military officer walked up the center aisle to the urn, picked up the flag, turned, and presented it to Nathan, saying, “On behalf of the President of the United States, the United States Army, and a grateful nation, please accept this flag as a symbol of our appreciation for your father’s honorable and faithful service.”

Since there was no casket, there was no pallbearer procession out of the church. However, traditionally the family walks down the center aisle and out. As it was a beautiful summer day, the funeral reception took place in the courtyard of the church. This gave all the mourners the opportunity to personally greet Nathan.

Nathan walked down the aisle with Kathy attending him. As he approached the last of the pews, he locked eyes and clearly understood the unknown man was Karl. Karl gave one nod, and Nathan had to walk on.

As he stepped out the rear door, there was no missing the spectacle of a fully laden log truck parked in front of the church. It looked like a cab from the 1950s sporting the Polleys Lumber logo on the door and lilies on the hood. Dan Polleys, the current patriarch of the Polleys lumber clan, stepped up to him, clapped him on the back, and said, "Your father deserves a send-off in style. He was a good man, and speaking for my late father, he was a good friend. If there's anything you need…"  
Nathan stopped listening and responded with a forced smile, while inside thinking, “You sold my father and every single employee at that mill down the river."

There were too many people: "So sorry for your loss"; "You're in our thoughts"; "It was so terrible what that company did to him"; "Oh, you're not married yet?"; "If there's anything you need, just call"; it went on and on. 

About halfway through the allotted time for the reception, the log truck started its diesel engine, revving it, idling it down so the stacks popped loudly, and then laid a long blast of its horn. It pulled away from the church and receded into the distance down Brooks Street.

Kathy came up to him and said, "Well, that's over the top."

"Yeah, they always did this when the old guys at the mill checked out. The log truck usually led the procession to the cemetery. I bet this is the last time it'll ever happen. IdaMont does seem the type to keep the tradition."

"Never did see that guy, Karl, come out of the church. Do you see him?"

"I wasn't paying attention. They're putting away the coffee. I think we can go now."

The funeral director and the church pastor both approached and shook Nathan's hand. They presented him with the urn.

He and Kathy walked down the street to Nathan's truck, and they drove off.
