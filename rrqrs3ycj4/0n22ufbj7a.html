                  The darker the symbol, the older the update.</p>
 
            </div>
                  
            <p><b><span id="U0000" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Ten days of thinking, five of them of it at my Bison Lakes base camp. I calmed down, made some peace in the forest and on the high ridges.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I needed to move on. Three years on the edge of Badger/Two Medicine was enough.</p>
<h2 id="RailroadCreekRanch">Railroad Creek Ranch</h2>
<p>I woke up on my last night in my cabin before dawn. I climbed out the sleeping bag on the bare mattress in the loft.</p>
<p>I may have been inside for the night, but I treated it as if I were camping—practiced it over the last few nights. I collected all that I would take with me. All stuff sacks—I packed them all up in my backcountry pack. I dropped it over the edge of the loft onto the couch.  Then I climbed down.</p>
<p>I looked around the room, all cleaned and tidy. Only sign I'd ever been there were the topo maps on the walls. Gladys said to leave them.</p>
<p>Next week, my cabin would be rented to tourists for seventy-five dollars per night. Outrageously expensive, but Gladys would more than make up the what I paid monthly in just a week.</p>
<p>I carried the pack out to where the bike sat parked pointing outward.</p>
<p>The Subaru—sold off. Mountain bike and cross country skis—given away. All most everything else packed, trashed, left behind, or burned.</p>
<p>The tent got strapped vertically on the sissy bar with bungees. My daypack, containing my rain jacket and hiking boots, clung to the tent with clips. Strapping the wilderness pack horizontally over the bike's rear seat.</p>
<p>Everything I owned in the world packed on the bike neatly in front of me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I started it before mounting, letting it warm-up for a few minutes while I gazed back at my cabin’s sagging front wall, the woodshed, and my forest of lodgepole pine.  Nodded once affirming my decision. It just didn’t seem like home anymore. I climbed onto the bike and rolled down to the main road.</p>
<p>At the fork, I turned right and rode to the restaurant. I hiked up the steps and pushed through the door. Gladys was in the midst of delivering breakfast plates to some of the overnight guests from the other cabins.</p>
<p>Once freed from the plates, she stood there looking at me. "You want pancakes?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>I sat in the booth where Vince and Gladys had reconnected last year. This time I took the view of Calf Robe mountain across the valley. I turned the coffee cup over and Kathy quickly brought poured me a cup.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before Gladys brought me a plate of pancakes and a second plate of bacon and eggs. I laughed. "I don't need that much."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Gladys glared at me. "You're not leaving without eating right."  She sat down across from me. "You decide where to?"</p>
<p>I had always avoided eye contact with her, too much like my mother. This time, I didn't want her skeptical comments.  I looked her right in the eye and stared her down like I stared down David. "You remember how Vince got to Butte? You and Ed were there."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She looked confused and uncharacteristically flustered. "I remember Vince when he was that scared kid living in back of the bike garage. Ed thought George was nuts for puttin' him up. You talkin' about that carnival?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Vince tried to chase his carnival when it left without him." I sighed. "I think I'm supposed to chase mine. Gotta be Reno."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I nodded to her, my mine pondering Nevada. Vince didn't find his carnival for years and then he found it, he didn't want it any more.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Examining a piece of bacon as if looking for a flaw, I closed our conversation as abruptly in the same manner as she had dismissed me so many times. I just stopped looking at her. I ate the bacon and pulled the pancake plate closer.</p>
<p>More customers arrived at the front desk. Kathy started to seat them.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Gladys sat there looking at me in silence. She shook her head slowly then stood up. "I gotta get back to the kitchen." She walked away, but then turned back. In a loud voice the whole restaurant could hear, "Don't you dare leave without coming to get me first."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Reno. I reviewed my mental map. US2 straight east to I-15. South all the way to Salt Lake City to pick up I-80 westbound. Simple—straight—fast. I could be there in two days.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I ate my breakfast in silence.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I got up and walked over to the kitchen door, pushed it open and announced in a loud voice, "I'm out of here."  Didn't bother waiting for a response.</p>
<h2 id="TheLeftTurn">The Left Turn</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The decision came only three miles down the highway: Two Medicine Road, a left turn away from my planned eastbound US2 to I-15 route. Didn't turn to the curves of Looking Glass Hill on purpose—just happened without thinking—good old MT49. Hit the left onto US89 up to St. Mary and then grabbed yet another left to the park entrance.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Left turns—my life revolves around left turns.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Waited in the queue, one vehicle at a time—two cars ahead.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I rolled up to the lady in the booth.</p>
<p>"Welcome to Glacier National Park. Six dollars for a motorcycle."</p>
<p>I handed her exact change.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She recited her script. "There's been a grizzly sighting near Sunrift Gorge. The parking area and trail are closed. It's beautiful day for ride over Logan Pass. You're going to have a great time on Going to the Sun today." She smiled and held out the park brochure.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I don't need the pamphlet. I've been here before."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I released the front brake, the clutch and rolled the throttle. Both cars in front of me had pulled into the St Mary visitor center.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shook my head while entering the first curve. There's nothing for me in Reno. Alone—that was always my path—time to embrace it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Crater Lake, California Redwoods, Yosemite—never seen them—time to change that.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>No traffic ahead of me—Going to the Sun's welcome to my next era.</p>
