            <h2 id="RailroadCreekRanch">Railroad Creek Ranch</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I woke up on my last night in my cabin before dawn. I climbed out the sleeping bag on the bare mattress in the loft.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I may have been inside for the night, but I treated it as if I were camping—practiced it over the last few nights. I collected all that I would take with me. All stuff sacks—I packed them all up in my backcountry pack. I dropped it over the edge of the loft onto the couch.  Then I climbed down.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked around the room, all cleaned and tidy. Only sign I'd ever been there were the maps on the walls. Gladys said to leave them.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Next week, my cabin would be rented to tourists for seventy-five dollars per night. Outrageously expensive, but Gladys would more than make up the what I paid monthly in just a week.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I carried the pack out to where the bike sat parked pointing outward.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The Subaru—sold off. Mountain bike and cross country skis—given away. All most everything else packed, trashed, left behind, or burned.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The tent got strapped vertically on the sissy bar with bungees. My daypack, containing my rain jacket and hiking boots, clung to the tent with clips. Strapping the wilderness pack horizontally over the bike's rear seat.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Everything I owned in the world packed on the bike neatly in front of me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I started it before mounting, letting it warm-up for a few minutes while I gazed back at my cabin’s sagging front wall, the woodshed, and my forest of lodgepole pine.  I nodded once, jumped onto the bike and rolled down to the main road.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>At the fork, I turned right and rode to the restaurant. I hiked up the steps and pushed through the door. Gladys was in the midst of delivering breakfast plates to some of the overnight guests from the other cabins.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Once freed from the plates, she stood there looking at me. "You want pancakes?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I nodded.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I sat in the booth where Vince and Gladys had reconnected last year. This time I took the view of Calf Robe mountain across the valley. I turned the coffee cup over and Kathy quickly brought poured me a cup.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It wasn't long before Gladys brought me a plate of pancakes and a second plate of bacon and eggs. I laughed. "I don't need that much."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Gladys glared at me. "You're not leaving without eating right."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She sat down across from me. "You know where you're going?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I had always avoided eye contact with her, too much like my mother. This time, I didn't want her skeptical comments.  I looked her right in the eye and stared her down like I stared down David. "You remember how Vince got to Butte? You and Ed were there."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She looked confused and uncharacteristically flustered. "I remember Vince when he was that scared kid living in back of the bike garage. Ed thought George was nuts for puttin' him up. You talkng about the carnival?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Vince had to chase his carnival." I sighed. "I think I gotta chase mine. I’m guessing, Reno."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I picked up a piece of bacon, looking at it as if it held a clue. I starting eating, closing our conversation as abruptly as she dismissed me so often.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>More customers arrived at the front desk. Kathy started to seat them.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Gladys sat there looking at me in silence. She shook her head slowly then stood up. "I gotta get back to the kitchen." She walked away, but then turned back. In a loud voice, "Don't you dare leave without coming to get me first."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I smiled at her and nodded. Then continued eating.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Reno. I reviewed my mental map. US2 straight east to I-15. South all the way to Salt Lake City to pick up I-80 westbound. Simple—straight—fast.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Maybe later. I've never seen the California Redwoods. Crater Lake, never seen that either. I've had some places to go before start the chase.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>...farewell with Gladys</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="GlacierNationalPark">Glacier National Park</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Aborted left turn on westbound US2. Right turn instead to the curves of Looking Glass Hill. Up to St. Mary to the park entrance...</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I took my turn in the queue, one vehicle at a time. Two cars ahead.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>On my turn, I rolled up to the lady in the booth.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Welcome to Glacier National Park. Six dollars for a motorcycle."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I handed her exact change.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She smiled and held out the park brochure. She over acted her script. "There's been a grizzly sighting near Sunrift Gorge. The pull off and trail are closed. It's beautiful day for ride over Logan Pass. You're going to have a great time on Going to the Sun Road today."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I don't need the pamphlet. I've been here before." I released the front brake and rolled the throttle.</p>
