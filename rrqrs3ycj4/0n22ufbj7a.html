<p>I woke up on my last night in my cabin before dawn. I climbed out the sleeping bag on the bare mattress in the loft.</p>
<p>I may have been inside for the night, but I treated it as if I were camping—practiced it over the last few nights. I collected all that I would take with me. All stuff sacks—I packed them all up in my backcountry pack. I dropped it over the edge of the loft onto the couch.  Then I climbed down.</p>
<p>I looked around the room, all cleaned and tidy. Only sign I'd ever been there were the maps on the walls. Gladys said to leave them.</p>
<p>Next week, my cabin would be rented to tourists for seventy-five dollars per night. Outrageously expensive, but Gladys would more than make up the what I paid monthly in just a week.</p>
<p>I carried the pack out to where the bike sat parked pointing outward.</p>
<p>The Subaru—sold off. Mountain bike and cross country skis—given away. All most everything else pack</p>
<p>The tent got strapped vertically on the sissy bar with bungees. My daypack, containing my rain jacket and hiking boots, clung to the tent with clips. Strapping the wilderness pack horizontally over the bike's rear seat, I realized that everything I owned sat in front of me.</p>
<p>I started it while standing next to it, letting it sit idle for a few minutes before I mounted. I took one last look around and headed down the road.</p>
<p>At the fork, I turned right and putted to the restaurant. I hiked up the steps and pushed through the door. Gladys was in the midst of delivering breakfast plates to some of the overnight guests from the other cabins.</p>
<p>Once freed from the plates, she stood there looking at me. "You want pancakes?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>I sat in the booth where Vince and Gladys had reconnected last year. This time I took the view of Calf Robe mountain across the valley. I turned the coffee cup over and Kathy quickly brought poured me a cup.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before Gladys brought me a plate of pancakes and a second plate of bacon and eggs. I laughed. "I don't need this much."</p>
<p>Gladys glared at me. "You're not leaving without eating right."  She sat down across from me. "You know where you're going?"</p>
