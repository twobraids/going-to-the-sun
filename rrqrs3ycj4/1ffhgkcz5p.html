                  The darker the symbol, the older the update.</p>
 
            </div>
                  
            <p><b><span id="U0000" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stood by the side door to the card room looking at the old bike—didn't know what model—didn't know who owned it. Only thing I could tell was it was custom built, the front wheel raked way out beyond any bike I had ever ridden.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned to Vince. "Why this bike? Mine's just sitting right over there." I gestured across the lot to my bike in front of my room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No questions. Go." He crossed his arms and looked down his nose at me. Dolph, Slim, Rooster, and Bull stood smirking behind him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I walked around the bike examining it closely. Kickstarter level on the right side—glad Chris taught about them last summer—I ran down the steps in my mind.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked back at them, stared for a minute, then nodded. "A set up. Can I go get the tools off my bike?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince shook his head.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Can I bum a pressure gauge from you?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince looked back to the rest of the guys as if consulting. Lot of head shakes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shrugged.  Turned the key, toed the shifter looking for neutral. No I shifted it all the way back down to first, hard shifted to second to get the feel of it, back down to first, then finessed the shifter to that halfway neutral click. The neutral light came on—there was at least some power in the battery for the coil. I turned the key to off.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pulled the choke, gave the kicker a couple of easy pumps with the ignition off, pulling fuel into the cylinders. I eased it down until the motor pushed back on me. Turned the key back on. Brought the pedal back to the top, leaned my weight on it, and climbed the kickstarter like bouldering on a mountain peak, full weight with a muscled downstroke all the way through.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The engine caught, but started to cough and belch black smoke. Feathering the choke didn't help—did they pour gas in the carb?. That was too quick, way more gas than those prime strokes should have pulled in.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I hit the key back to off.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Several of the guys behind Vince laughed. I turned to look. Dolph frowned at me as he handed a couple bills to Rooster. Vince made a point of looking at his watch.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Sabotage, too much gas too fast—throttle open. Can't be the only thing, though. Gotta check the carb.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I started with the air filter. The cover didn't look suspicious. I snagged my swiss army knife from my pocket, flipped open the flat blade. The cover unscrewed and popped off. The greasy blue rag wrapped around the filter made me shake my head. I pealed it off, tossed it to the ground, then pulled the filter off entirely. Nothing else obvious blocking airflow. Working the choke knob demonstrated the choke plate moved correctly in its full range of motion.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Deeper down the throat looked wrong—butterfly way too open. I stood up, grabbing the throttle. Didn't budge with a light twist, nor with a harder turn. With a grunt, I grabbed the lock screw and twisted it. The throttle sprung back to idle.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A couple guys uttered disappointment. The "yes" came from Dolph and I glanced back as Rooster handed the bills back.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I'm a fucking race horse for their wagers—everything's about trading money—Vince's carnival.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My bandana quickly removed the excess gas in the carb. Replaced the air filter, then I tightened the cover. Still gas in the air—had to wait a while longer. Plugs could be wet—got no way to pull them. Do other things—then move on.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The front hand brake checked out fine. The rear brake felt good, too. I trusted they didn't want to kill me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Back to starting. No need for priming strokes, bike started easily and settled down to a decent idle. I smiled. I let it sit there for a couple minutes to let the bike establish its rhythm. Vince looked at his watch after about four minutes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I killed the engine. The oil tank cap popped off easily. Wiped the dip stick on my thigh leaving a dark stain on my jeans.  Pushed it back in for a moment and then checked the oil level. Slightly low, not enough to worry about for this short trip.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I got down on my knees to check under the bike for anything dripping. Nothing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I mounted the bike and leaned it off the side stand. My ear cocked to the tank, I rocked the bike from side to side. Sloshed like what I expected for a couple gallons. Good enough.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>For the third time, I kicked the bike to life, hopped on, dropped into first, feathered the clutch and moved out. That raked out fork made for really wide turns. No wonder Vince and Chris never take their choppers out on the curves.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The bike worked fine until I got to the first traffic light—about a mile down the highway—the shift level just swung loose—couldn't downshift. I pulled the clutch and rolled to a stop on the right shoulder near the crosswalk. I killed the bike again.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The shift lever out on the front peg had come loose from the linkage back to the transmission case. The rod hung loose from the transmission end.  The little right angled ball at the end fell broke free of its socket on the shifter. They fit back together easily, but nothing held it in place. Hard to see inside the socket—rough sharp edge said broken, rather than just a missing grommet. Couldn't get them to stay together on their own.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>String—them together. Duct Tape—might not flex enough. I leaned against the bike staring a the kick lever for a minute or two, absently stroking my braids. Do I cut a braid off to tie fix this? I shuddered—maybe to save my life—not for a beer run. My hand felt the answer at the end of my braid—elastic hair tie.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It worked perfectly for the one block to the little shopping center with grocery store, Buttrey Foods.  I didn't walk directly in to buy beer, I detoured into the Coast to Coast hardware store across the lot and bought a roll of duct tape.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Out in back of the grocery store, the sour smelling alley. I snagged a milk crate from a pile. I used the duct tape to lash the crate to the sissy bar. Then I went into the grocery store and bought a case of Rainier. It sat perfectly in the crate.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I rode back to the Iron Horse—nothing else went south on me. Suspected I got off easy.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I swung the bike around to the side door. Nobody waiting. Got the bike spotted to exactly where it sat a half hour ago.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>With the beer on the ground, my Swiss Army knife made quick work of the tape holding the crate. After wadding up the tape, I just tossed the milk crate over toward the garbage bins further along the wall.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The door banged open in front of me as I picked up the beer. Slim poked his head out, focused on me. He disappeared back inside while shouting, "Twobraids' back! That was him."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He popped out and stepped up. "Goddamn Twobraids, we expected you to take an hour and have to walk back."  He stepped to the right side of the bike looking puzzled at the pipes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince came out next, followed by a bunch of guys. Vince smiled at his watch, then grinned at me. "How long you been back?" Dolph stepped up and clapped me on the back.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Just a couple minutes."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I watched Dolph join Slim inspecting the pipes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I held the beer out to Vince. He gestured for Bull to take it while joining the other guys at the inspection. Bull took the case from me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Slim stood up looking at me. "How did you get them back on?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Careful—this sounded like a trick. I chose the evasive answer because I had no idea what he meant.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"He didn't." Vince looked up from next to the pipes. "They didn't come off."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Slim looked indignant. The brackets</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He frowned at me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rooster strode over to the left side of the bike to examine the shifter linkage.  He laughed. "It's one of those little girl hair ties he wears in his beard."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No way." Slim ducked around to where Rooster stood. "Christ. I think I'm gotta get me some of those."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I flinched as Luke put his arm over my shoulder. "I think you nailed it buddy.  I've never seen anyone get back so fast."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I've seen all I need to. Let's get back inside and do this." Vince raised his arm signally everyone to go back in.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0048" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>With me it tow, they filed back toward the club room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rooster routed me to the empty bar. "You wait here." Then he walked away.</p>
<h2 id="ClubRoomattheHorse">Club Room at the Horse</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0051" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Nobody told me what to expect inside. It was so silly, they led me in blindfolded. They made step up onto a platform and kneel. Since they brought me in via the rear door, I knew it was the platform where we’d set up the poker tables for New Years.</p>
