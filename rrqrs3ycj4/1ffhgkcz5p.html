            <p><b><span id="U0000" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stood by the side door to the card room looking at the old bike—didn't know what model—didn't know who owned it. Only thing I could tell was it was custom built, the front wheel raked way out beyond any bike I had ever ridden.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I want a case of twelve ounce bottles. Get it from Buttrey's on US2 in Whitefish."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned to Vince. "Why this bike? Mine's just sitting right over there." I gestured across the lot to my bike in front of my room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No questions. Go." He crossed his arms and looked down his nose at me. Dolph, Slim, Rooster, and Bull stood smirking behind him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I walked around the bike examining it closely. Kickstarter lever on the right side—glad Chris taught about them last summer—I ran down the steps in my mind.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked back at them, stared for a minute, then nodded. "A set up. Can I go get the tools off my bike?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince shook his head.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Can I bum a pressure gauge from you?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince looked back to the rest of the guys as if consulting. Lot of head shakes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shrugged.  Turned the key, toed the shifter looking for neutral. No I shifted it all the way back down to first, hard shifted to second to get the feel of it, back down to first, then finessed the shifter to that halfway neutral click. The neutral light came on—there was at least some power in the battery for the coil. I turned the key to off.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pulled the choke, gave the kicker a couple of easy pumps with the ignition off, pulling fuel into the cylinders. I eased it down until the motor pushed back on me. Turned the key back on. Brought the pedal back to the top, leaned my weight on it, and climbed the kickstarter like bouldering on a mountain peak, full weight with a muscled downstroke all the way through.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The engine caught, but started to cough and belch black smoke. Feathering the choke didn't help—did they pour gas in the carb?. That was too quick, way more gas than those prime strokes should have pulled in.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I flicked the key back to off.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Several of the guys behind Vince laughed. I turned to look. Dolph frowned at me as he handed a couple bills to Rooster. Vince made a point of looking at his watch.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Sabotage, too much gas too fast—throttle open. Can't be the only thing, though. Gotta check the carb.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Air filter, first on the list. The cover didn't look suspicious. I snagged my swiss army knife from my pocket, flipped open the flat blade. The cover unscrewed and popped off. The greasy blue rag wrapped around the filter made me shake my head. I pealed it off, tossed it to the ground, then pulled the filter off entirely. Nothing else obvious blocking airflow. Working the choke knob proved the choke plate moved correctly in its full range of motion.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Deeper down the throat looked wrong—butterfly way too open. I stood up, grabbing the throttle. Didn't budge with a light twist, nor with a harder turn. With a grunt, I twisted the lock screw on the handgrip. The throttle sprung back to idle.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A couple guys uttered disappointment. The "yes" came from Dolph and I glanced back as Rooster handed the bills back.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I'm a fucking race horse for their wagers—everything's about trading money—Vince's carnival.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My bandana quickly wicked up the excess gas in the carb. Replaced the air filter, secured the cover. Still gas in the air—had to wait a while longer. Plugs could be wet—got no way to pull them. Concentrate on what I can do—then move on.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The front hand brake checked out fine. The rear brake felt good, too. I trusted they didn't want to kill me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Back to starting. No need for priming strokes, bike started easily and settled down to a decent idle. I smiled. I let it sit there to let the bike establish its rhythm. Vince looked at his watch after about four minute of idle.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I killed the engine. The oil tank cap popped off easily. Wiped the dip stick on my thigh leaving a dark stain on my jeans.  Pushed it back in for a moment and then checked the oil level. Slightly low, not enough to worry about for this short trip.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I got down on my knees to check under the bike for anything dripping. Nothing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I mounted the bike and leaned it off the side stand. My ear cocked to the tank, I rocked the bike from side to side. Sloshed like what I expected for a couple gallons. Good enough.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>For the third time, I kicked the bike to life, hopped on, dropped into first, feathered the clutch and moved out. That raked out fork made for really wide turns. No wonder Vince and Chris never take their choppers out on the curves.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The bike worked fine until I got to the first traffic light—about a couple miles down the highway—the shift level just swung loose—couldn't downshift. I pulled the clutch and rolled to a stop on the right shoulder near the crosswalk. I killed the bike again.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The shift lever out on the front peg had come loose from the linkage back to the transmission case. The rod hung loose from the transmission end.  The little right angled ball at the end broke free of its socket on the shifter. They fit back together easily, but nothing held it in place. Hard to see inside the socket—rough sharp edge said broken, rather than just a missing grommet. Couldn't get them to stay together on their own.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>String—tie them together. Duct Tape—might not flex enough. I leaned against the bike staring a the kick lever for a minute or two, absently stroking my braids. Do I cut a braid off to tie fix this? I shuddered—maybe to save my life—not for a beer run. My hand felt the answer at the end of my braid—elastic hair tie.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It worked perfectly for the one block to the little shopping center with grocery store, Buttrey Foods.  I didn't walk directly in to buy beer, I detoured into the Coast to Coast hardware store across the lot and bought a roll of duct tape.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Out in back of the grocery store, the sour smelling alley, I snagged a milk crate from a pile. I used the duct tape to lash the crate to the sissy bar. In the grocery store and bought a case of Rainier. It nested perfectly in the crate.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I rode back to the Iron Horse—nothing else went south on me. Suspected I got off easy.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I swung the bike around to the side door. Nobody waiting. Spotted the bike exactly where it sat a half hour ago.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>With the beer on the pavement, my Swiss Army knife made quick work of the tape holding the crate. After wadding up the tape, I just tossed the milk crate over toward the garbage bins further along the wall.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The door opened in front of me as I picked up the beer. Slim poked his head out, focused on me. He turned his had and shouted back inside, "Twobraids' back! That was him."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He stepped out looking at me with his head cocked to one side. "Goddamn Twobraids, how'd you get back so quick?"  He knelt down on the right side of the bike looking at the pipes with puzzlement.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince came out next, followed by a bunch of guys. Vince smiled at his watch, then grinned at me. "How long you been back?" Dolph stepped up and clapped me on the back.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Just a couple minutes."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph joined Slim inspecting the pipes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I held the beer out to Vince. He gestured for Bull to take it while joining the other guys at the inspection.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Slim stood up looking at me. "How'd you get them back on?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Careful—this sounded like a trick. I chose the evasive answer because I had no idea what he meant.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"He didn't." Vince looked up from next to the pipes. "They didn't come off."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Slim looked indignant. "I loosened those brackets myself." He frowned at me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph "Hot metal expands. He warmed it up. That held 'em."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Several of the guys laughed while Slim looked chagrined.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rooster strode over to the left side of the bike to examine the shifter linkage.  He laughed. "It's one of those little girl hair ties he wears in his beard."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No way." Slim ducked around to where Rooster stood. "Christ. I think I'm gotta get me some of those."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0048" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I flinched as Luke put his arm over my shoulder. "I think you nailed it buddy.  I've never heard of anyone get back so fast.  Pipes should'a come off before you got outta the lot."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I've seen all I need to. Let's do this." Vince raised his arm signalling everyone to go back in.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0050" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>With me it tow, they filed back toward the club room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0051" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rooster routed me to the empty bar. "You wait here." Then he walked away.</p>
<h2 id="ClubRoomattheHorse">Club Room at the Horse</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Nobody told me what to expect inside. The ritual seemed so silly, they led me in blindfolded. They led me to the platform at the far end of the clubroom, same place they staged the poker tables at New Years. A heavy hand, smelled like Vince, pushed me down to my knees.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0054" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Couldn't see a damn thing</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince's voice boomed out, settling the guys from talking. "The prospect, Twobraids, kneels for judgement. Does anyone sponsor him for ascension to the brotherhood?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0056" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I stand for Twobraids." Dolph's voice.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0057" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Silence for a moment.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I stand for Twobraids." Rooster's voice—surprised to me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0059" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Another beat of silence.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0060" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I stand for Twobraids."  This time, Luke's voice.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0061" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"We have three. Who gives testimony for his ascension? How has he served the Bastards?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0062" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A chair scraped on the rough floor. "It takes more than muscle to run the Bastards." Chris's voice. "Twobraids brings skills we've never had. While his card dealing skills have brought in cash, his knowledge of computers has reinvented the administration of the club as well giving us new ways to bring in cash."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0063" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A pause with a couple murmurs. Couldn't tell who.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0064" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"New Year's Eve." Dolph spoke for me. "Twobraids' spotted Foresters' mole. He watches, he notices. He reported it right n' stepped back. Not a word since. That's respecting his place. That's loyal."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0065" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A few moments of silence. "I ain't never done this before. Probly won't do it right." Slim's voice, a bit quavery, like he freaked out about speaking in front of the guys. "I was agin' him. Guys said he hadn't ridden even a year." He paused like he had to rebuild his thoughts. "I seen him ride. He makes that Wide Glide of his corner like a Jap bike. Left us looking like Grampa John on Fletcher Pass." He let a beat pass. "Reminded me of Ed."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0066" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I flinched.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0067" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah, I saw it." Rooster's voice interrupting.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0068" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Slim paused, flustered by Rooster, then continued, "He got the bike back this morning. Still don't git how he carried the beer."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0069" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A bunch of guys laughed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0070" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"We have three." Vince called out.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0071" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I call for a vote."  Sounded like Whiskey.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0072" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Second." Rooster.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0073" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I couldn't tell what they did next. Nobody spoke. Chairs shuffled and I heard guys slowly filing from my right to my left. Everyone passed by me—I felt like I an auction item—my life here was just selling myself. From the left came the faint sound of poker chips—landing every couple of seconds on top of one another. It went on for minutes as they seemed to return to their places at the table.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0074" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The silence went on for quite a while—minutes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0075" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Prospect Twobraids." Startled the shit out of me. Vince spoke from right behind me—didn't hear him get there.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0076" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A hand grabbed the back of my vest. "I strip you of your pledge patch." He yanked it down forcing my arms down and back. Holy shit—they've rejected me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0077" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I release you from your vow of loyalty to the Bitterroot Bastards. You are a free man." He paused—I was horrified.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0078" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"As a free man, do you accept membership into the Bitterroot Bastards as a full brother, fully knowing the duties, the risks, and the bond you’ll carry to your grave?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0079" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Jesus Christ—Vince and his carnivals. I let it hang for a moment. "I'm all in."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0080" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I heard Chris laugh from somewhere off to my left.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0081" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince continued. "Brother Twobraids, stand up and accept your patch."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0082" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stood up. Vince pulled my blindfold off. He stood in front of me grinning with a worn jean jacket with an embroidered bastards patch. I pulled it on, embarrassed by the formality of the ceremony. Such an anachronism.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0083" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Apparently that was the end of the ceremony as every one got up from the table, many of the guys stepping up to congratulate me.</p>
