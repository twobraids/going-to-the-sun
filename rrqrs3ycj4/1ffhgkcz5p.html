            <h2 id="TheIronHorse">The Iron Horse</h2>
<p>I stood by the side door to the card room looking at the old bike—didn't know who owned it. A neglected dinosaur with a wheel raked way out front. Ape hangers. Rusty parts. Dents in the tank.</p>
<p>"I want a case of twelve ounce bottles. Must be bottles. Get it from the Buttrey's store on 93 in Whitefish."</p>
<p>“A beer run, for a guy standing next to his own bar?” I turned to Vince, not expecting an answer. "Why this bike? Mine's just sitting right there." I gestured across the lot to my Wide Glide in front of my room.</p>
<p>"No questions. You're takin' the rat bike. Go." He crossed his arms and looked down his nose at me. Dolph, Slim, Rooster, and Bull stood smirking behind him.</p>
<p>I knew what this was all about. Tests and challenges, part of the life of a prospect. In February, they had me chopping wood. Finish an undisclosed number of these tests and pledges become brothers.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Kickstarter lever on the right side—glad Chris taught me about them last summer—I didn't see the point—just got it.  He had me start his own chopper over and over. Didn’t let me ride it, though. His voice droning at me, enumerating each step—like running a program in my head.</p>
<p>I looked back at the guys for a minute, then nodded. "It’s a set up. Can I go get the tools off my bike?"</p>
<p>Vince shook his head.</p>
<p>"Can I bum a pressure gauge from you?"</p>
<p>Vince looked back to the rest of the guys as if consulting. Lot of head shakes. "You ride it with what you got on ya."</p>
<p>I shrugged and let out a long breath. Methodical steps—the software to start the hardware.</p>
<p>Turned the key, toed the shifter looking for neutral. I shifted it all the way back down to first, hard up to second to get the feel of it, back down to first, then finessed it to that halfway neutral click. Not one of those weird old backwards patterns. The neutral light came on—at least some power in the battery for the coil. I turned the key back to off.</p>
<p>I pulled the choke, gave the kicker a couple of easy pumps, pulling fuel into the cylinders. I eased it down until the motor pushed back on me. Turned the key back on. Brought the pedal back to the top, leaned my weight on it, and climbed the kickstarter like leaping up onto the next boulder on a mountain peak, full weight with a muscled downstroke all the way through.</p>
<p>Glad to be a hiker.</p>
<p>The engine caught, but started to cough and belch black smoke. Feathering the choke didn't help—did they pour gas in the carb? That happened way too quick—more gas than those prime strokes should have pulled in.</p>
<p>Cut off the ignition.</p>
<p>Several of the guys behind Vince laughed. I turned to look. Dolph frowned at me as he handed a couple bills to Rooster.</p>
<p>Vince made a point of looking at his watch.</p>
<p>Sabotage, too much gas too fast. Won’t be just one cause—first step, check the carb.</p>
<p>Air filter—cover didn't look suspicious. I snagged my Swiss Army knife from my pocket, flipped open the flat blade screw driver. The cover unscrewed and popped off.</p>
<p>A greasy blue rag smothered the filter.</p>
<p>Shaking my head with disapproval, I peeled it off, tossed it to the ground.  Yanked the filter off and peered into the carb. Nothing obvious blocking airflow. Working the choke lever proved its plate moved correctly in its full range of motion.</p>
<p>Deeper down the throat looked wrong—butterfly way too open. I reached up, grabbing the throttle. The throttle didn't budge with a light twist, nor with a harder turn. With a short grunt of understanding, I twisted the lock screw on the handgrip. The throttle sprung back to idle. Butterfly looked right.</p>
<p>A couple guys uttered disappointment behind me. The "yes" came from Dolph and I glanced back as Rooster handed the bills back.</p>
<p>I'm a fucking race horse for their wagers—everything's about trading money around here—Vince's carnival.</p>
<p>My bandana wicked up the excess gas in the carb. Replaced the air filter, secured the cover. Still smelled of gas—had to wait a while longer. Plugs could be soaked—got no way to pull them. Concentrate on what I can do—then move on.</p>
<p>Focused at the brakes, their condition, the feel of activating them. They both checked out. I trusted they didn't want to kill me.</p>
<p>Back to starting it. No need for priming strokes. With one kick, the bike roared and settled down to a decent syncopated idle. I smiled. I let it sit there to get settled into its cadence. Vince looked at his watch after about four minutes of idling.</p>
<p>I killed the engine.</p>
<p>Silence from the guys.</p>
<p>The oil tank cap popped off easily. Wiped the dip stick on my thigh leaving a dark stain on my jeans.  Pushed it back in for a moment and then checked the oil level. Slightly low, not enough to worry about for this short trip.</p>
<p>I got down on my knees to check under the bike for anything dripping. Clean.</p>
<p>I mounted the bike and leaned it off the side stand. My ear cocked to the tank, I rocked the bike from side to side. Sloshed like what I expected for a couple gallons. Good enough.</p>
<p>For the third time, the bike kicked into life. I jumped on the saddle from what felt like the wrong side, chunked the transmission into first, feathered the clutch and moved out toward the road. Swung really wide on that turn out of the lot. Goddamn—that raked out fork wrecks the turning radius—no wonder Vince and Chris never took their choppers out on the curves. Riding down the street with arms way up over my head—ape hangers—stupidly impractical bike.</p>
<p>It ran fine until I got to the first traffic light, a couple miles down the highway. The shift lever out by my left boot just swung loose. Couldn't downshift. I pulled the clutch and rolled to a stop on the right shoulder near the crosswalk. I shut down the bike again.</p>
<p>The shift lever had come loose from the linkage back to the transmission case. The rod hung down at an angle from the transmission.  The little ball at on the shift lever had broken free of its socket on the transfer arm. They fit back together easily, but nothing held them in place. Hard to see inside the socket—rough sharp edge said broken—not just a missing grommet.</p>
<p>String—tie them together. Duct Tape—might not flex enough. I leaned against the bike staring at the useless shifter for a minute or two, absently stroking my braids.</p>
<p>Do I cut a braid off to tie this?</p>
<p>I shuddered—maybe to save my life—not for a stupid beer run. My hand felt the answer at the end of my braid—elastic hair tie.</p>
<p>It worked a charm for the next couple miles to the shopping center.  I didn't walk directly in to buy beer, I detoured into the Coast to Coast hardware store across the lot and bought a roll of duct tape.</p>
<p>Out back of the grocery store, in the sour smelling alley, I snagged a milk crate from a pile. I duct taped the crate to the sissy bar on the rear seat.  Once I had that secured, I bought a case of Rainier in bottles. It nested perfectly in the crate.</p>
<p>I rode back to the Iron Horse—nothing else went south on me. Figured I got off easy.</p>
<p>I swung the bike around to the side door. Nobody waiting. Spotted the it exactly where it sat a half hour ago right on top of that blue rag.</p>
<p>With the beer set down on the pavement, my Swiss Army knife made quick work of the tape holding the crate. After wadding up the tape, I just tossed the milk crate over toward the garbage bins further along the wall.</p>
<p>The door to the card room opened in front of me as I picked up the beer. Slim poked his head out, focused on me looking surprised. He shouted back inside, "He's back! That was him we heard."</p>
<p>He stepped out looking at me with his head cocked to one side. "Goddamn, Two Braids, how'd ya git back so quick?"  He knelt down on the right side of the bike looking at the pipes with puzzlement.</p>
<p>Vince came out next, followed by a bunch of guys. Vince smiled at his watch. "How long you been back?"</p>
<p>Dolph stepped up and clapped me on the back giving me a broad smile.</p>
<p>"Just a couple minutes."</p>
<p>Dolph joined Slim inspecting the pipes.</p>
<p>I held the beer out to Vince. He gestured for Bull to take it while joining the other guys at the inspection.</p>
<p>Slim stood up looking at me. "How'd you git ‘em back on?"</p>
<p>Careful—this sounded like a trick. I chose the evasive answer because I had no idea what he meant.</p>
<p>"Force of will."</p>
<p>"He didn't put them back on" Kneeling at the exhaust, Vince looked up at me. "They never come off."</p>
<p>Slim looked indignant. "I loosened them brackets myself." He frowned at me.</p>
<p>Dolph answered with his theory. "Hot metal expands. He warmed it up b'fore he left. That held 'em."</p>
<p>Several of the guys laughed while Slim looked chagrined.</p>
<p>Rooster strode over to the left side of the bike to examine the shifter linkage.  He laughed. "Looks like one of those little girl hair ties he wears in his beard."</p>
<p>"No way." Slim ducked around to where Rooster stood. "Christ. I gotta get me some'a them things."</p>
<p>I flinched as Rook put his arm over my shoulder. "You nailed it, buddy. Never heard of anyone gettin’ back that fast." He laughed. "Those pipes should’ve dropped before you got outta the lot."</p>
<p>"I've seen all I need to. Let's do this." Vince raised his arm signaling everyone to go back in.</p>
<p>They didn’t just dismiss me this time—they herded me back inside. A church morning…</p>
<p>Rooster routed me past the club room corridor into the empty bar. "You wait here." Then he walked away.</p>
<h2 id="ClubRoomattheHorse">Club Room at the Horse</h2>
<p>Nobody told me what to expect inside the Club Room. The ritual seemed so silly, they led me in blindfolded. As if I hadn’t ever seen it—dealt cards for them a dozen times in there. They took me up onto the platform at the far end of the clubroom, same place they staged the poker tables at New Years.</p>
<p>A heavy hand, smelled like Vince, pushed me down to my knees.</p>
<p>Couldn't see a damn thing.</p>
<p>Vince's voice boomed out, settling the guys from their talking.</p>
<p>"The prospect, Two Braids, kneels for judgement. Who here’ll stand sponsor for him?"</p>
<p>Commotion for a moment, several voices speaking at once as if coordinating.</p>
<p>"I stand for Two Braids." Dolph's voice.</p>
<p>Silence for a moment.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0074" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I stand for Two Braids." Rooster's voice—surprised me—didn’t think he liked me much.</p>
<p>Another beat of silence.</p>
<p>"I stand for Two Braids."  This time, Rook's voice from far down the table.</p>
<p>"He has three. Who testifies? Tell us how the prospect has earned his place."</p>
<p>A chair scraped on the rough floor. "It takes more than muscle to run the Bastards, the bar, and the rest of our operations." Chris's voice. "Two Braids brings skills we've never had. While his card dealing skills have brought in cash, his knowledge of computers has reinvented the administration of the club as well giving us new ways to bring in the cash that we all share."</p>
<p>A pause with a couple murmurs. Couldn't tell who.</p>
<p>"New Year's Eve." Dolph again. "Two Braids' spotted Foresters' mole. He watches, makes connections rest of us don’t see. Followed orders. Kept quiet. That's respecting club’s authority. That's loyalty."</p>
<p>A few moments of silence.</p>
<p>"I ain’t never done this before. Prob’ly won’t do it right.” Slim’s voice came quavery, like talking in front of the guys spooked him.</p>
<p>"I was agin’ him. The guys said he hadn’t even rode but a year." He paused, rebuilding his thoughts. "I seen him ride. He makes that Wide Glide corner like a Jap bike. Left us looking like Grampa John on Fletcher Pass." He paused again, then sounded wistful. "Reminded me of Brother Acid."</p>
<p>I flinched.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I saw it, too." Rooster's voice interrupting.</p>
<p>Slim paused, flustered by Rooster, then continued, "Ain’t many of us ever got the rat bike any more’n half as far as him. Still don’t git how he hauled the beer."</p>
<p>A bunch of guys laughed.</p>
<p>"He has three." Vince called out.</p>
<p>"I call for a vote."  Sounded like Whiskey.</p>
<p>"Second." Rooster.</p>
<p>I couldn't tell what they did next. Nobody spoke. Chairs shuffled and scuffed. I heard guys slowly filing from my right to my left. Everyone passed by me—I felt like I an auction item—my life here was just selling myself. From the left came the faint sound of poker chips—landing every couple of seconds on top of one another. It went on for minutes as the guys seemed to return to their seats at the table.</p>
<p>"Prospect Two Braids." Startled the shit out of me. Vince spoke from right behind me—didn't hear him get there.</p>
<p>A hand grabbed the back of my vest. "I strip you of your pledge patch." He yanked it down forcing my arms down and back.</p>
<p>Holy shit—they've rejected me.</p>
<p>"I cut you loose from your oath." His voice stern—angry? He paused as if waiting for me to respond. "You're' a free man."</p>
<p>I was horrified.</p>
<p>"You may walk away." Again, a pregnant pause. I didn’t know how to act, I froze.</p>
<p>"Or, as a free man, you can accept the chains of a new oath. One of loyalty, trust, and obedience as a brother of the Bitterroot Bastards.  Will you take the cut, the risk, the bond that ends only with the grave?"</p>
<p>Jesus fucking Christ—Vince and his goddamn carnival.</p>
<p>I let it hang for a moment of my own.</p>
<p>"I'm all in."</p>
<p>I heard Chris chuckle from somewhere off to my left.</p>
<p>Vince continued. "Brother Two Braids, stand up and accept the symbol of the bond with your brothers."</p>
<p>I stood up. Vince yanked my blindfold off. He stood in front of me grinning holding a worn sleeveless jean jacket with an embroidered Bastards patch. I pulled it on.</p>
<p>I held my poker face, fighting a smile. Vince and I clasped wrists, then he yanked me into a fraternal hug.</p>
<p>Apparently that was the end of the ceremony as every one got up from the table, many of the guys stepping up to congratulate me.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0108" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Spent afternoon riding formation with the bastards around Flathead Lake, stopping at a bar in Polson and overwhelming the tiny bar in Elmo.</p>
