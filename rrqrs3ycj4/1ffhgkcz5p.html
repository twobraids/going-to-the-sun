            <h2 id="TheIronHorse">The Iron Horse</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stood by the side door to the card room looking at the old bike—didn't know who owned it. Chopped into a dinosaur with a wheel raked way out front. Ape hangers. Handle bars so high, my own arms would block my view to the sides.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I want a case of twelve ounce bottles. Must be bottles. Get it from Buttrey's on US93 in Whitefish."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“A beer run, for a guy standing next to his own bar?” I turned to Vince, not expecting an answer. "Why this bike? Mine's just sitting right there." I gestured across the lot to my Wide Glide in front of my room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No questions. You're takin' the rat bike. Go." He crossed his arms and looked down his nose at me. Dolph, Slim, Rooster, and Bull stood smirking behind him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I knew what this was all about. Tests and challenges, part of the life of a prospect. In February, they had me chopping wood. Finish an undisclosed number of them, then pledges become brother</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I walked around the bike examining it closely. I had seen it before in Chris and Vince's bike barn. I thought it was someone project. I didn’t pay much attention to it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>No electric start. Kickstarter lever on the right side—glad Chris taught me about them last summer—I didn't see the point then. I got it now.  He had me start his own chopper over and over, but didn’t let me ride it. His voice droned in my head setting out each step—like running a program in my head.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked back at the guys for a minute, then nodded. "It’s a set up. Can I go get the tools off my bike?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince shook his head.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Can I bum a pressure gauge from you?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince looked back to the rest of the guys as if consulting. Lot of head shakes. "You ride it with what you got on ya."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shrugged and let out a long breath. Methodical steps—the software to run the hardware.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Turned the key, toed the shifter looking for neutral. I shifted it all the way back down to first, hard up to second to get the feel of it, back down to first, then finessed it to that halfway neutral click. Not one of those weird old backwards patterns. The neutral light came on—at least some power in the battery for the coil. I turned the key back to off.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pulled the choke, gave the kicker a couple of easy pumps, pulling fuel into the cylinders. I eased it down until the motor pushed back on me. Turned the key back on. Brought the pedal back to the top, leaned my weight on it, and climbed the kickstarter like bouldering on a mountain peak, full weight with a muscled downstroke all the way through.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Glad to be a hiker.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The engine caught, but started to cough and belch black smoke. Feathering the choke didn't help—did they pour gas in the carb? Too quick, way more gas than those prime strokes should have pulled in.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Cut off the ignition.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Several of the guys behind Vince laughed. I turned to look. Dolph frowned at me as he handed a couple bills to Rooster. Vince made a point of looking at his watch.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Sabotage, too much gas too fast—throttle open. Can't be the only thing, though. Gotta check the carb.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Air filter, first on the list. The cover didn't look suspicious. I snagged my swiss army knife from my pocket, flipped open the flat blade. The cover unscrewed and popped off. A greasy blue rag smothered the filter.  My head shaking disapproval, I peeled it off, tossed it to the ground.  Yanked the filter off and peered into the carb. Nothing obvious blocking airflow. Working the choke lever proved its plate moved correctly in its full range of motion.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Deeper down the throat looked wrong—butterfly way too open. I stood up, grabbing the throttle. The throttle didn't budge with a light twist, nor with a harder turn. With a short grunt of understanding, I twisted the lock screw on the handgrip. The throttle sprung back to idle.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A couple guys uttered disappointment behind me. The "yes" came from Dolph and I glanced back as Rooster handed the bills back.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I'm a fucking race horse for their wagers—everything's about trading money around here—Vince's carnival.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My bandana wicked up the excess gas in the carb. Replaced the air filter, secured the cover. Still smelled of gas—had to wait a while longer. Plugs could be soaked—got no way to pull them. Concentrate on what I can do—then move on.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Focused at the brakes, their condition, the feel of activating them. They both checked out. I trusted they didn't want to kill me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Back to starting it. No need for priming strokes. With one kick, the bike roared and settled down to a decent syncopated idle. I smiled. I let it sit there to let the bike get settled into its cadence. Vince looked at his watch after about four minutes of idling.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I killed the engine.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Silence from the guys.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The oil tank cap popped off easily. Wiped the dip stick on my thigh leaving a dark stain on my jeans.  Pushed it back in for a moment and then checked the oil level. Slightly low, not enough to worry about for this short trip.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I got down on my knees to check under the bike for anything dripping. Nothing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I mounted the bike and leaned it off the side stand. My ear cocked to the tank, I rocked the bike from side to side. Sloshed like what I expected for a couple gallons. Good enough.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>For the third time, the bike kicked into life. I jumped on the saddle from what felt like the wrong side, chunked the transmission into first, feathered the clutch and rode out. Swung really wide on that turn out of the lot. Goddamn—that raked out fork wrecks the turning radius—no wonder Vince and Chris never took their choppers out on the curves. My arms really did block my view—stupidly impractical bike.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It worked fine until I got to the first traffic light, a couple miles down the highway. The shift lever out by my left boot just swung loose. Couldn't downshift. I pulled the clutch and rolled to a stop on the right shoulder near the crosswalk. I shut down the bike again.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The shift lever had come loose from the linkage back to the transmission case. The rod hung down at an angle from the transmission.  The little ball at on the shift lever had broken free of its socket on the transfer arm. They fit back together easily, but nothing held them in place. Hard to see inside the socket—rough sharp edge said broken—not just a missing grommet. They just flopped apart.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>String—tie them together. Duct Tape—might not flex enough. I leaned against the bike staring at the useless shifter for a minute or two, absently stroking my braids.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Do I cut a braid off to tie this?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shuddered—maybe to save my life—not for a stupid beer run. My hand felt the answer at the end of my braid—elastic hair tie.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It worked a charm for the next mile to the shopping center.  I didn't walk directly in to buy beer, I detoured into the Coast to Coast hardware store across the lot and bought a roll of duct tape.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Out back of the grocery store, in the sour smelling alley, I snagged a milk crate from a pile. I duct taped the crate to the sissy bar on the rear seat.  Once I had that secured, I bought a case of Rainier bottles. It nested perfectly in the crate.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I rode back to the Iron Horse—nothing else went south on me. Figured I got off easy.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I swung the bike around to the side door. Nobody waiting. Spotted the it exactly where it sat a half hour ago.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>With the beer on the pavement, my Swiss Army knife made quick work of the tape holding the crate. After wadding up the tape, I just tossed the milk crate over toward the garbage bins further along the wall.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The door opened in front of me as I picked up the beer. Slim poked his head out, focused on me looking surprised. He shouted back inside, "He's back! That was him we heard."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He stepped out looking at me with his head cocked to one side. "Goddamn, Two Braids, how'd ya git back so quick?"  He knelt down on the right side of the bike looking at the pipes with puzzlement.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince came out next, followed by a bunch of guys. Vince smiled at his watch. "How long you been back?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph stepped up and clapped me on the back.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Just a couple minutes."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0048" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph joined Slim inspecting the pipes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I held the beer out to Vince. He gestured for Bull to take it while joining the other guys at the inspection.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0050" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Slim stood up looking at me. "How'd you git ‘em back on?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0051" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Careful—this sounded like a trick. I chose the evasive answer because I had no idea what he meant.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0052" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Force of will."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"He didn't put them back on" Vince looked up from next to the pipes. "They didn't come off."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0054" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Slim looked indignant. "I loosened them brackets myself." He frowned at me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph answered with his theory. "Hot metal expands. He warmed it up b'fore he left. That held 'em."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0056" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Several of the guys laughed while Slim looked chagrined.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0057" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rooster strode over to the left side of the bike to examine the shifter linkage.  He laughed. "Looks like one of those little girl hair ties he wears in his beard."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No way." Slim ducked around to where Rooster stood. "Christ. I gotta get me some'a them things."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0059" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I flinched as Luke put his arm over my shoulder. "You nailed it, buddy. Never heard of anyone gettin’ back that fast." He laughed. "Those pipes should’ve dropped before you got outta the lot."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0060" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I've seen all I need to. Let's do this." Vince raised his arm signaling everyone to go back in.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0061" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Different this time—they dragged me back in with them. A church morning…</p>
<p><b><span id="U0062" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rooster routed me into the empty bar. "You wait here." Then he walked away.</p>
<h2 id="ClubRoomattheHorse">Club Room at the Horse</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0064" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Nobody told me what to expect inside the Club Room. The ritual seemed so silly, they led me in blindfolded. They took me up onto the platform at the far end of the clubroom, same place they staged the poker tables at New Years. A heavy hand, smelled like Vince, pushed me down to my knees.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0065" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Couldn't see a damn thing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0066" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince's voice boomed out, settling the guys from their talking.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0067" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"The prospect, Two Braids, kneels for judgement. Who here’ll stand sponsor for him?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0068" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I stand for Two Braids." Dolph's voice.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0069" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Silence for a moment.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0070" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I stand for Two Braids." Rooster's voice—surprised to me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0071" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Another beat of silence.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0072" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I stand for Two Braids."  This time, Luke's voice from far down the table.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0073" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"He has three. Who testifies? Tell us how the prospect earned his place."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0074" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A chair scraped on the rough floor. "It takes more than muscle to run the Bastards, the bar, and the rest of our operations." Chris's voice. "Two Braids brings skills we've never had. While his card dealing skills have brought in cash, his knowledge of computers has reinvented the administration of the club as well giving us new ways to bring in cash that we all share."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0075" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A pause with a couple murmurs. Couldn't tell who.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0076" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"New Year's Eve." Dolph spoke for me. "Two Braids' spotted Foresters' mole. Reported what he saw. Followed orders. Kept quiet. That's respecting club’s authority. That's loyalty."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0077" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A few moments of silence.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0078" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I ain’t never done this before. Prob’ly won’t do it right.” Slim’s voice came quavery, like talking in front of the guys spooked him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0079" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I was agin’ him. The guys said he hadn’t even rode but a year." He paused, rebuilding his thoughts. "I seen him ride. He makes that Wide Glide corner like a Jap bike. Left us looking like Grampa John on Fletcher Pass." He paused again, then sounded wistful. "Reminded me of Brother Ed."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0080" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I flinched.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0081" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah, I saw it, too." Rooster's voice interrupting.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0082" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Slim paused, flustered by Rooster, then continued, "Ain’t many of us ever got the rat bike any more’n half as far as him. Still don’t git how he hauled the beer."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0083" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A bunch of guys laughed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0084" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"He has three." Vince called out.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0085" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I call for a vote."  Sounded like Whiskey.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0086" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Second." Rooster.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0087" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I couldn't tell what they did next. Nobody spoke. Chairs shuffled and scuffed. I heard guys slowly filing from my right to my left. Everyone passed by me—I felt like I an auction item—my life here was just selling myself. From the left came the faint sound of poker chips—landing every couple of seconds on top of one another. It went on for minutes as the guys seemed to return to their seats at the table.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0088" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The silence went on for quite a while—minutes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0089" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Prospect Two Braids." Startled the shit out of me. Vince spoke from right behind me—didn't hear him get there.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0090" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A hand grabbed the back of my vest. "I strip you of your pledge patch." He yanked it down forcing my arms down and back.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0091" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Holy shit—they've rejected me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0092" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I cut you loose from your oath." His voice stern—angry? He paused as if waiting for me to respond. "You're' a free man."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0093" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I was horrified.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0094" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You may now walk away." Again, a pregnant pause.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0095" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Or, as a free man, you can accept the chains of a new oath. One of loyalty, trust, and obedience as a brother of the Bitterroot Bastards.  Will you take the cut, the risk, the bond that ends only with the grave?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0096" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Jesus fucking Christ—Vince and his goddamn carnival. I let it hang for a moment of my own. Though I couldn't see him, I turned my face up to where I figured he stood.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0097" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I'm all in."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0098" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I heard Chris chuckle from somewhere off to my left.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0099" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince continued. "Brother Two Braids, stand up and accept the symbol of the bond with your brothers."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0100" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stood up. Vince yanked my blindfold off. He stood in front of me grinning holding a worn sleeveless jean jacket with an embroidered Bastards patch. I pulled it on.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0101" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I held my poker face, fighting a smile. Vince and I clasped wrists, then he yanked me into a fraternal hug.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0102" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Apparently that was the end of the ceremony as every one got up from the table, many of the guys stepping up to congratulate me.</p>
