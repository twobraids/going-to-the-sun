<p>I woke up abruptly in the same bed as yesterday—this time, alone. The silence of the room seemed unnatural. At home in my cabin during summer, there’s always a constant cacophony of birds. Yesterday, the sound of Vince and Chris fucking. Today, tomb-like silence. The room felt sealed off, not just from the forest around the building, but from the rest of the house.</p>
<p>9:20 a.m. on the bedside clock.</p>
<p>I climbed out of bed and found my riding leathers draped over a chair. I hadn't pulled my regular clothes from the saddlebags when I arrived last night. I wasn't sure I was going to spend the night here. I left everything on the bike but what I had on my back.</p>
<p>I stepped up to the window to peer out, not realizing at first what direction the window faced. It wasn't outward toward the valley. I couldn't see the driveway, let alone my bike.</p>
<p>The stresses and uncertainty of yesterday started to seep into my thoughts. I tried to push them down, but they seemed to ooze between my mental fingers.</p>
<p>My stomach growled.</p>
<p>I turned from the window and walked over to the closed bedroom door. The Bitterroot Bastards MC overlay had returned to its hook. I stepped up to it and examined it closely. Clearly, it was years old. Some frayed threads on the edges of the embroidery stood frozen in tangled contortions as if caught trying to escape.</p>
<p>Stains. One mark looked like a finger-width smear of dried blood brown. A hug from someone with a bleeding hand? My eyes lingered as I imagined the history behind this patch: the network of highways it had traced facing backwards. I figured this was Vince's patch.</p>
<p>I turned away and stepped into the adjoining bathroom to take a leak. The vanity had two sinks and a huge mirror that stretched over the whole wall. The shower took up a third of the room. It wasn't an enclosed space at all, no curtain. Just a pair of shower heads in the tiled wall and a cubby shelf for soap and shampoo, a fancy locker room  shower.</p>
<p>After draining my bladder, I noticed the other door, closed, directly across from where I had entered. I stepped up to it, slowly, ever so quietly turned the handle, pushed softly, and peered in. Another bedroom, much the same size as the other, similar furniture but a different feel given by the artwork and photos. On the dresser, I focused on a black-and-white photograph in a silver metal frame. A much younger Chris stood between a man and a woman, a palm tree in the background. His parents? I backed out, turning the doorknob slowly to ensure a silent latch.</p>
<p>I returned to the room where I woke up. I examined the scattered artifacts on the walls, bed table, and dresser. A framed black-and-white photo hung on the wall over the dresser. It looked like a scene from the midway of a carnival. I tried to find Vince in the photo, but they were all strangers to me. A second frame held an old two-color handbill or small poster, yellow with age, advertising a carnival: "Western Star Shows". A three-quarter view drawing of a Ferris Wheel dominated the space with depictions of game booths and what looked like a very fat lady with a beard surrounded by a crowd of disembodied faces of happy parents and children.  Hand-lettered in an open space at the bottom: "Cody Stampede Rodeo Grounds, August 10-16  10AM to Midnight."</p>
<p>"Grew up in that carnival." I whipped around in surprise, not having heard the door open. Vince stood facing me looking first at the poster and then to me.</p>
<p>With a weak smile, he stepped over to me. "Chris found the poster and photo in an antique shop in Reno. Gave ’em to me for my birthday when we first moved here."</p>
<p>“What year was the poster?”</p>
<p>“Coulda been anytime late forties, early fifties. Same with the photo. See the guy runnin’ the Ferris Wheel? That’s Clancy. Rest of ’em—just marks.”</p>
<p>"I can't imagine what that would have been like."</p>
<p>"It was rough. Didn’t know it then. Just how life was. Got a fuck of a lot rougher.” He put a hand on my shoulder. "Came up here to get you outta bed. We gotta get ready to ride the Park. You hungry?"</p>
<p>"Yeah"</p>
<p>He turned, expecting me to follow. "Let's get you some grub.”</p>
<p>We walked down the stairs that landed between the kitchen and living room. No sign of Chris or Sarah.</p>
<p>Vince spoke over his shoulder. "What do you usually eat?"</p>
<p>"I eat a lot of oatmeal."</p>
<p>Vince laughed. "Oatmeal. Only thing I know how to make. Been eatin’ that forever."</p>
<p>"I can make it myself."</p>
<p>"Nah, you're the guest here."</p>
<p>Vince made way more oatmeal than only one person could eat. It may have been the only thing he knew how to cook, but it also seemed the only quantity that he knew how to cook. He did, though, teach me something. I had never occurred to me to cook it with butter. It really did add a lot more flavor than my trial and error technique ever gave  me.</p>
<p>As I sat down to eat, Chris came in from one of the back rooms and sat down across from me.</p>
<p>"Congratulations. I've verified your dealer’s license. You're registered as one of our dealers. I talked to Alan at the Ox, too. Said you were a good dealer, but you refused to shave your beard for their dress code. I approve."</p>
<p>Vince laughed. "That beard’s an asset. Gonna pull in the right customers. We want the bikers that party hard, spend easy. You’ll see—lady dealer with the biggest tits pulls the most action. That’s Lonna. Guy that gets the most play? It’s the one the marks see themselves in. You got the look. Your table’ll stay packed."</p>
<p>I smiled over my bowl of oatmeal.</p>
<p>Vince sat down next to Chris. "Listen, I know you ain’t keen on leavin’ your Honda here. Still want ta see you on the Ironhead. Dolf’s bringin’ his truck, pickin’ the Honda up. He’ll meet us in East Glacier this afternoon, at that big hotel, and follow us back to your place, unload it. If you’re dead set on not keepin’ the Ironhead, he’ll haul it back. But I’d rather you keep it."</p>
<p>I thought for a minute, wondering how to get over the feeling that I'm usurping Ed's bike. "How many of the bikes in your garage are owned by guys in prison?"</p>
<p>"None. Ten of ’em used to belong to club brothers doin’ time. I bought 'em at a Missoula County sheriff auction."</p>
<p>I gave him a puzzled look. "Why?"</p>
<p>"I bought ’em so they stayed club. Some might come back for ’em one day. Some won’t. Either way, they ain’t gonna rot behind a chain-link fence or end up in the garage of some asshole poser with a fantasy. They’re here, safe. If a brother needs a loaner..." He cut that off, leaned forward at me, and met my eyes.</p>
<p>I got the message. "I'll ride the Ironhead today and make a final decision when I get home."</p>
<p>Chris cleared his throat. "Are you guys done? May I continue briefing my new dealer?" He pushed another paper across the table to me. A handwritten list of dates and times. "I've drawn up a dealing schedule for you. We're gonna get you started real quick. Your first shifts'll be this week, Friday and Saturday." He pointed to the first two entries. "Friday will be your training day. I want you here at around noon."</p>
<p>Chris pointed to the Saturday entry. "This'll be a different kind of day. The Bastards' have their midsummer meeting Saturday afternoon. Some of the guys will ride in on Friday, but most will arrive on Saturday morning. There's not a lot of us, but it'll be a good party."</p>
<p>Vince added, "Want you to meet the rest of the club members. Wanna get them to know you real quick. We’re hostin’ another MC Saturday night. Foresters, chapter outta Western Oregon and Washington. Headin’ to Deadwood, South Dakota for their big annual run. Loggers can be a rough bunch, but like Chris said, gonna be a hell of a party."</p>
<p>Chris nodded. "Throwin’ you straight into the fire, but you already know—we’re short on dealers. You'll learn fast. Foresters roll through every year, good crowd especially at the poker tables. "</p>
<p>Vince interrupted again. "Word is they’re lookin’ to start a chapter in Missoula. Got a crew down there now—some old Bastards, some unaffiliated. They’ll be headin’ up here too. Don’t expect trouble. Might be pitchin’ to rope us in—we got brothers workin’ the sawmill. I’ll hear ’em out, but I ain’t draggin’ the Bastards into somethin’ I can’t control."</p>
<p>Chris flashed Vince an impatient look and reasserted his agenda. "Next week, I got you in for three days. After that, four weeks with a five-day schedule, Thursdays through Mondays. That's when we'll be most crowded. This look good to you?"</p>
<p>I nodded. "Where am I staying while I'm here?"</p>
<p>"Got a room for you at the motel we’re renovatin’ next to the Horse. Not quite finished, but the plumbing works. You get a one-minute commute. Lot between the Horse and the motel’s gettin’ blocked off in a couple weeks. This is big for us—food vendors, four-week party, new people rollin’ through every day. Vince’s thing. Everything he touches turns into a carnival."</p>
<p>"Fuck off." Vince stood up, picking up my empty bowl and taking it to the dishwasher.</p>
<p>Chris smirked and watched Vince walk away, then turned back to me. "That's really all we need to cover today about dealin'. I'm gonna need a couple signatures, but we can do that when ya get here for your first shift on Friday."</p>
<p>Vince came back over to the table. "Let’s talk about the ride. Figure you know the Park better’n we do. We’ve ridden through plenty, but never stopped much. Anything you think we oughta see?"</p>
<p>"Are you guys up for some hiking?"</p>
<p>"Maybe something short. I'd like to see things you can't see from the road."</p>
<p>"Sunrift. Short, not well known, amazing. It's on the east side of Logan Pass." I paused trying to think of other hikes. "Avalanche Creek is really good, about a three-hour hike, only a thousand feet up. Avalanche Lake, a cirque lake, a mile-wide amphitheater, hundreds of waterfalls cascading down from the snowfields all around. The whole valley roars with falling water."</p>
<p>Vince returned to the table and sat down. "First one sounds okay. We don't got time for the second one."</p>
<p>"I'd really love to show you the Grinnell Glacier Overlook. It’s like standing on the edge of a knife looking down thousands of feet onto snowfields. The trail crosses the Garden Wall. It’s like the Going to the Sun road, but it’s a trail only three feet wide. Nearly straight up and down on either side. That's a ten-mile round trip and pretty steep. Not something for a quick day trip."</p>
<p>Chris laughed. "You’re miles ahead of us when it comes to trompin’ around the wilderness. Send us a postcard."</p>
<p>I flashed on one of my favorite hikes just a few miles from my cabin. "Oh, Trick Falls. It's not on Going to the Sun, but on the Two Medicine Road. Half mile, flat, a really crazy waterfall. That's perfect."</p>
<p>Vince responded, "Sounds good. We wanna time this right, hit West Glacier for lunch. Puts us in East Glacier meetin’ Dolph around dinner. Now, here’s the thing—me ‘n Chris ridin’ back west after? ‘Cause I wanna see your place. Curious how you live. You got space for us to crash for the night?"</p>
<p>I hesitated for a second, thinking about all the crap piled everywhere in my cabin. "Yes... it would be great to have you two spend the night. I'm gonna have to shovel some shit around, though. We can sleep in the loft, less to move. I'm not a housekeeper. I don't have running water. I think I have enough in the tank for three. I only have electricity and lights when I run the generator."</p>
<p>Chris laughed. "No hot tub?"</p>
<p>"I heat water on the propane stove. You can have hot water a kettle at a time."</p>
<p>"It'll do. Lived worse." Vince assured me. "We gotta hit the highway in ‘bout a half hour. Ironhead’s down at the Horse. I’ll call Dolph, have him grab the Honda there. We need to get going pretty soon.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got a few more things to get done in the office.” Chris got up from the table. “Can you give me thirty minutes?”</p>
<p>We dropped my Honda at the Horse forty-five minutes later. I switched to Ed’s Ironhead Sportster and we rolled out toward Glacier Park.</p>
<h2 id="GlacierNationalPark,Montana">Glacier National Park, Montana</h2>
<p>Another forty minutes later with Vince riding point, me riding middle, and Chris riding tail, we pulled into a roadside tavern near the West Glacier entrance to Glacier National Park.</p>
<p>West Glacier is not really the name of the town; it's actually Belton, established by the Great Northern Railway in the 1890s. It's the de facto main entrance to the Park, but that hadn't been the original intent. When Glacier National Park opened in 1910, the railroad planned that most tourists would travel on their trains from the east. So they built their grand Glacier Park Hotel on the east side of Marias Pass. On the west side, they built the significantly smaller, modest, Belton Chalet. Over the course of the twentieth century, as the railroad lost significance in favor of car and air travel, the western Belton entrance dominated over the remote eastern entrance. The name shifted gradually to West Glacier driven by the tourist trade favoring advertising symmetry.</p>
<p>This was our lunch stop, the same tavern where David and I stopped on our ride over Logan Pass. I noted that neither Vince nor Chris had beer with their meal.</p>
<p>This ride up Going to the Sun lacked the stress of the ride with David. Even in best conditions, it’s not a fast ride anywhere. It’s a spectacle for a slow crawl. If you screwed up at speed, you’d be just as dead here as anywhere else, but here it would have been spectacular, potentially catching air for 1,000 feet.</p>
<p>Every time I've ridden around that one-eighty at The Loop, I've marveled at the incredible achievement of 1920s engineering. This highway took fifteen fucking years to build. I read that they started back in 1918, and they fought about the route even after starting the construction.</p>
<p>Rounding those outside curves with the sheer cliffs on either side, the audacity of the project was undeniable. The surveyors had to hang from climbing ropes to make measurements to mark the future roadbed. How many men died building this absurd highway?</p>
<p>I concentrated on keeping my place in formation while riding. Vince always took the middle of the road or the left side. I tried to stay strictly on the right side, close to the cliff edge. Watching Chris in the rearview mirror, he stayed tightly on the left side of the lane.</p>
<p>Our ascent of the west side didn't go perfectly. We rounded one corner and had to brake hard for a backup of cars. I could trace the traffic jam on a half mile of road ahead of us. We sat with our boots on the ground for almost a half hour.</p>
<p>When we eventually got moving and crawled forward, we saw one of the Red Jammers blocking the lane.  Its left front wheel folded under the chassis: a broken axle. These old motor coaches may have been built like tanks back in the 1930s, but after nearly sixty years on this route, metal fatigue caught up with them.</p>
<p>A few miles further on, the Weeping Wall had changed mood entirely from a month ago. Instead of a furious downpour from an ice-cliff, hundreds of joyful flowing rivulets cascaded down the rock face along the entire 150-foot length. Yeah, the pavement still got wet, but only from light wind spray. The water ran into a diversion channel that funneled under the road where it resumed its fall into the valley below.</p>
<p>We pulled into the parking lot at the Logan Pass Visitor Center as a tourist bus disgorged a mob of Japanese tourists. Our noisy Harleys caught their attention, and the cameras came out. I laughed at what must have been a couple hundred Fuji Film moments taken of the three of us rolling in.</p>
<p>We crowded the three bikes together into one automobile parking space. A month earlier, I stood on a snow drift twenty feet above this asphalt. We started walking to the Visitor Center, but clearly the tourists from the bus weren't done with us. A woman with two young children in tow ran up to us, "Picture? Picture?" Then assuming our assent, they posed themselves in front of us, and the father snapped pictures. Afterwards, they all bowed to us several times and then rushed toward the visitor center.</p>
<p>Seeing that this was to be repeated, I came up with an alternate plan. "Let's head over across the highway. I've got something to show you."</p>
<p>Looking uncomfortable with the attention, Vince and Chris followed me to the start of the Highline Trail.</p>
<p>"There's a short walk here that I want you to see. It's not far."</p>
<p>We walked up the trail as it wound through some boulder debris either from construction or just natural rock fall from the cliff above.  Rounding a boulder, an animal blocked the path.</p>
<p>"Holy shit," Vince called out.</p>
<p>A snow-white mountain goat, the Great Northern Railway's logo incarnate, gazed casually at us. It took a step forward, turned, and made a small leap, then ascended effortlessly up the boulders on impossibly narrow outcrops and cracks in the stone. It gave us side-eye over its shoulder and then wandered out of sight.</p>
<p>"That was not what I planned to show you, but cool.  I want you to see the Ledge ahead."</p>
<p>We continued along the trail for another quarter mile as the pathway seemed to end at a cliff face. Rounding the last curve, the trail turned sharply to become a ledge carved into the stone. The Park Service had bolted a rope handrail to the rock. The path, only about six feet wide, had no barrier on the outer edge, a sheer vertical drop. It stretched about another four hundred yards where the cliff switched from bare rock to a less severe, less vertical slope covered in wildflowers.</p>
<p>Vince walked out onto the trail known as The Ledge, laughing like a delighted child, except a couple of octaves lower. He stood at the edge and looked down, turned around, and looked up the face of the rock wall. The top was not visible due to an overhang. He turned back, and I saw his smile disappear. I turned to look where Vince looked and saw Chris standing back at the start of The Ledge, frozen, a terrified expression on his face. Vince quickly walked back to him and put an arm on his shoulder. Neither of us could convince Chris to take a step onto The Ledge, even holding onto the rope.</p>
<p>Chris agreed to stay there while Vince and I walked out the full extent of The Ledge and returned.</p>
<p>"This is the route to get to the Grinnell Glacier Overlook that I told you about earlier. It's about five miles further." I pointed to the sweeping Garden Wall dotted with melting snowbanks, crumbling rock outcrops, and a profusion of colored wildflowers.</p>
<p>Vince looked out over the Logan Creek Valley below. "I wanna see it. Maybe we can find time later this summer."</p>
<p>Vince had that adventure grin that I've seen on many of my hiking buddies over the years. His smile thrilled me in the same way that David's approval did. It's so cool to introduce these men to some of the joys of my life. I felt I was paying them in turn for the new experiences they had given me.</p>
<p>We turned and walked back to Chris, now standing looking away from the Ledge.</p>
<p>I took the lead to our next stop on the highway after escaping from a busload of what sounded like German tourists in the parking lot.</p>
<p>Our next stop, Sunrift Gorge, came up in eight miles. The turnout for the parking area was not well marked; most people miss it.  For this short hike, only a couple hundred yards, I followed instead of leading. I wanted to see their reaction when they recognized the illusion.</p>
<p>Baring Creek is trapped in a rocky gorge as it tumbles down a steep slope. The trail starts above the stream but quickly descends to near water level. The odd thing is that this stream appears to be coming from the base of a cliff plugging the gorge ahead. There should be a waterfall there, but there’s only a blank rock wall. Only in the last twenty feet does the spell break. The gorge takes a literal ninety-degree turn to the left. The stream emerges from rock split cleanly, forming a perfect straight-walled cleft, thirty feet high. No wider than the ten-foot width of the creek, it runs arrow straight for a quarter mile.</p>
<p>I again got the warm glow when I heard both Vince and Chris gasp as they saw it. There is so much joy in seeing others appreciate the same things I do.</p>
<p>Chris looked at me. “How in the fuck?”</p>
<p>“Only ten thousand years ago, all this was under glaciers. Glaciers are heavy. They literally bent and broke this huge slab of rock. This is the crack. This giant slab of rock shifted a dozen feet downhill. All these creeks coming off the mountains are new; they didn't exist before the glaciers. Water's always gonna find the easiest path down. The basin above started to drain; the creek way up at the other end turned to follow the crack. When it got here, it found another way to continue its flow down to St. Mary Lake. One creek, two ninety-degree turns."</p>
<p>Vince shook his head. "That's fucking amazing."</p>
<p>Chris gave me a queer look. "How the hell do you know all this geology stuff? Thought you were the computer whiz."</p>
<p>I smiled a him. "I have a minor in geology. I took classes from that professor that wrote the book, Roadside Geology of the Northern Rockies. It tells stories about geology you can see from specific highway pullouts. I've practically memorized it."</p>
<p>Back at the bikes, I stopped them from remounting. I took them to the railing on the valley side of the parking area. I pointed to the mountain directly across the valley on the far side of St. Mary Lake: Mahtotopa Mountain. “See that dark band in the rock? Up near the top.”</p>
<p>They both indulged me. Chris said, “Yeah, it’s got white layers on the top and bottom.”</p>
<p>“That’s the Percel sill. The rock above and below the dark band is limestone almost a billion and a half years old. It was laid down by a vast sea. One point one billion years ago, magma, that’s what lava is called when it doesn’t erupt onto the surface, forced its way through a crack between the layers of limestone, pushing that immense weight up nearly three hundred feet. It was so hot that it cooked the limestone and turned it into marble.”</p>
<p>Vince looked at me and asked, “Those white lines on either side are marble?”</p>
<p>“Yep. That’s just the start of the story of these mountains. All this rock you see didn’t even come from here. They were all laid down fifty miles west. The Rocky Mountains started with the earth bulging up from under all these layers. When the bulge got high enough, all this rock broke off and slid eastward fifty miles.”</p>
<p>Chris interrupted me. “Karl, you got a hardon?”</p>
<p>That tripped me up. I lost my train of thought completely, stuttering into silence. Self-consciously, I put my hand to my crotch to check. Yeah, I had a hardon.</p>
<p>I adopted my flattest poker face. I refused to be embarrassed.</p>
<p>He laughed. “Some guys talk dirty when they fuck me. I want you to fuck me and talk about rocks.”</p>
<p>Vince joined Chris’s laughter. I held my poker face and gestured to the bikes. We rode on, Vince retaking the lead. We stopped for gas at the same station that David and I used—even more expensive than it was a month ago.</p>
<p>“Vince, I want to give you some directions.” I called over to Chris, “You need to hear this too.” Chris came over.</p>
<p>“We’re going to take 89 south to the intersection with Montana 49. That’s the climb over Looking Glass Hill, a kick-ass set of curves, the best I’ve found anywhere around here. There are potholes and no guard rails anywhere. When we get to the other side of the hill, take the hard right onto Two Medicine Road.”</p>
<p>Vince interrupted me, “This is your turf. It makes more sense if you take point.”</p>
<h2 id="EastGlacierPark,Montana">East Glacier Park, Montana</h2>
<p>I nodded, walked back to the Ironhead, mounted it, and led the way out of the gas station.</p>
<p>We encountered pretty heavy tourist traffic until we tuned onto 49. There’s a sign warning about a rough road, tight turns, length restrictions, and towing vehicle restrictions. Most tourists skip this shortcut for the longer route through Browning.</p>
<p>The Ironhead clearly didn’t carve curves like the Honda. It seemed so top-heavy. I nearly fucked up the first outside curve. It didn’t take me long to adjust, though. Goddamn, but I wished this road were twenty miles longer. When I got to that long straight stretch before the turn to Two Medicine, I looked in my mirror and didn’t see them behind me. I slowed until I saw their headlights round that last curve. I stopped at the junction and waited for them to catch up.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, we arrived at the Trick Falls trailhead. Vince rolled up beside me. “It didn’t take you long to figure out the Ironhead. I saw you misjudge that first curve. You nailed the next three. Then you were gone. You left us eating your dust. I get why you like that Honda. You ought to try one of those real head-first sport bikes. If you can stand the damn screaming whine. Kawasaki Ninja, inline-four, liquid-cooled. Like I said before—I sure as fuck wish I was your age again.”</p>
<p>We parked and started down the trail. This is another largely level trail that winds through the forest paralleling the Two Medicine River. The trail fords the Dry Fork of the river, but I've never seen it actually dry. It takes some stepping from boulder to boulder to not get wet. Vince and Chris did just fine. The trail then returns to the main river channel where it ends abruptly on the gravel bench in front of the falls.</p>
<p>When Vince emerged from the trees and caught his first look at the falls, he stopped abruptly. "What the fuck?"</p>
<p>Chris crowded up behind him, stopping abruptly too. He turned back to face me with a look of confusion and then looked back at the falls. They stepped forward onto the gravel and walked closer.</p>
<p>For the third time today, my body buzzed with the thrill of showing my friends something they had never seen before. I stood there admiring the falls, kind of caught up in my own head. Suddenly, I realized they both faced me looking expectant. I shrugged.</p>
<p>Chris spoke up, "Well, come on, get your dick hard and explain what the holy fuck is going on here. Or do I have to suck your dick to get you to talk now?"</p>
<p>I smiled and explained. "I'll take the blow job later." Damnit, my dick got hard at his solicitation. "The river falls over Karst limestone 350 million years old, way younger than the limestone we saw at the Percell Sill an hour ago. Even slightly acidic water can dissolve limestone. The glacier of this valley exposed the limestone, and the meltwater stream started to erode it. It hasn't finished the job. It created a tunnel through the rock, and that's why you see the opening of a cave mouth with water pouring out. The tunnel it made isn't big enough for the whole river's flow. That's why there's water pouring over the lip above the cave opening: two waterfalls at the same place for the price of one. By next month, the flow over the top will stop entirely and not start again until next spring's snow melt."</p>
<p>Vince said, "That’s fuckin’ amazing. Fourteen years here, never knew these places existed. Appreciate you showin' us, Karl."  Chris nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Back on the bikes, we headed back down the hill to the town of East Glacier. It only took about twenty minutes or so. Vince, leading again, turned into the parking area for the big hotel made of huge logs. I could easily see my Honda standing in the back of Dolph's truck. He stood in the empty parking space next to his truck as if he were guarding it for our arrival. Turns out, he did, he just stood there wearing his Bastard's overlay, intimidating anyone that dared try to park in that space. We pulled in and dismounted.</p>
<p>"Got any suggestions where we can go to eat?" Vince asked.</p>
<p>I was about to answer when Dolph spoke up. I've rarely ever heard him talk. "Wanna eat here." He pointed to the hotel.</p>
<p>I tried to dissuade them. "That's a really fancy restaurant in there. The kind with white tablecloths. Really pricey, too."</p>
<p>Dolph looked at me, standing there like the unmovable mountains. "Already checked it out. They let anyone in. I wanna eat here."</p>
<p>Vince said, "Yeah. Let's go for it. Just right in front of us."</p>
<p>I let out a low hiss, shaking my head. "Vince, I can't afford to eat here. It’s really expensive."</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it. I’ve got you."</p>
<p>Chris gave me a what's-wrong-with-you look that I didn't understand.</p>
<p>The four of us walked up to the main entrance of the hotel. I really felt uncomfortable with all the staff and tourists staring at us. We entered the main hall, a wooden cathedral lined with huge vertical logs, still covered in bark, supporting a ceiling also made of logs maybe sixty feet above us. These trees had to have been three feet in diameter. I didn't know anywhere in Montana where trees like that grew. I figured when the Great Northern Railway built this place back in 1910, they must have logged the forests somewhere way west. They couldn't be local. It’s too dry on this side of the continental divide to grow trees like that.</p>
<p>The maître d’ at the front of the restaurant did not bat an eye at the four bikers wanting entry to his dining room. He had a table for us immediately.</p>
<p>It was a meal such as I had never experienced. The several courses peaked with bison steaks, baked potatoes, and asparagus spears. I'm not sure I've ever eaten like that. Chris negotiated a bottle of wine for the table, but, of course, I only took a tiny sip to participate in Vince's toast. I didn't like it.</p>
<p>After the meal, we retired to the expansive deck on the backside of the hotel facing the mountains: a magnificent view, but not as stunningly rugged as most of what we had seen earlier in the day. Chris pulled out a bundle of four cigars. I had never smoked a cigar before, and it took me a while to get the gist of it. My pot smoker habits wanted me to inhale, and I made that mistake several times. Cigars are puffed. The smoke is supposed to stay in the mouth, not sucked into the lungs. I could not help but see the parallel with sucking dick.</p>
<h2 id="RailroadCreekRanch">Railroad Creek Ranch</h2>
<p>We returned to the bikes and headed toward my cabin. Not much of a ride; it literally takes only ten minutes. I led the way under the BN underpass to the intersection with US2, Dolph bringing up the rear in his truck. We turned left onto Railroad Creek Road and then the right fork that leads to my A-frame.</p>
<p>I circled around near the deck to facilitate backing the bike into the woodshed.  On seeing the restricted turning radius that Dolph would have to contend with, Vince and Chris parked parallel with the deck to take up as little room as possible. Dolph got the idea immediately, pulled in, and executed a perfect multipoint turn to get enough room to deploy his ramp.  Once parked, he had the ramp set up and pulled the Honda down in short order.</p>
<p>I took over, pushing it into the woodshed next to the Harley.</p>
<p>Vince grinned at me. "So I guess this means that you're keeping the Ironhead."</p>
<p>I hadn't even given it a thought. I just parked it where it looked like it belonged. I had unconsciously made my decision.</p>
<p>I nodded to Vince.</p>
<p>Standing next to his truck's door, Dolph looked to Vince. "You need anything more?"</p>
<p>"We're good, Dolph. Appreciate you haulin’ Karl’s bike over."</p>
<p>I jumped in, realizing that I owed thanks to Dolph, too. "Yes, Dolph, thank you for taking the time to bring the Honda home."</p>
<p>Dolph nodded to me and announced, "Going back to Whitefish now."</p>
<p>"See ya, Dolph," Chris and Vince said nearly simultaneously.</p>
<p>He got back in the truck, started it, and disappeared back down the road.</p>
<p>"Well, welcome to my cabin," I said as I stepped onto the front deck and up to the door. "I'm gonna have to do some straightening up before there's even a place for you to sit down." I led them in to see the chaotic detritus of my life.</p>
<p>I showed them the front room, the kitchen, and the lower bedroom. "The rest of the space is just the loft above the bedroom. I usually sleep up there."</p>
<p>"It's getting dark, can we have some lights on in here?" Chris asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'll have to start the generator for lights, but I haven't got much gas in it right now."</p>
<p>"You don't even have a television, do you?" Chris inquired.</p>
<p>"No television, no phone. There's a water tank connected to the sink, but I don't have a way to fill it. I use these five-gallon jugs. I've got both a wood stove and a propane heater. I have a transistor radio up in the loft, but the batteries are dead. I used up my last paycheck from the teaching gig, so I couldn't buy any more."</p>
<p>"Didn't you just pull a thousand bucks from our card room? You somehow spent it already?" Chris pointed out.</p>
<p>"Oh, wow, yeah. That seems like months ago. I put in the Honda's saddle bag when I switched bikes at the bar last night. I should have gone to the store when we were in town. I'm sorry, I'm so used to watching every penny.” I didn't have to worry about eating at the restaurant. I could've paid my own way.</p>
<p>Vince caught my eye. "I know how it is, Karl. Been there. Don’t want you worrying about it. Dinner was on me. Now we got you on the payroll, you ain’t gotta stress over money again. That’s a promise."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Vince, you too, Chris. Even with the poker winnings, I'd really be fucked by the end of that summer if I hadn't hooked up with you guys."</p>
<p>Chris pointed out, "You could have come back to the Horse and played poker."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but I really don't like doing that. I really don't like taking advantage of people. I went in there Saturday night with a hundred-fifty bucks to my name. If I had lost, I'd be livin' in the Subaru at the end of the month."</p>
<p>Chris shook his head. "Bullshit, you know how to bluff."</p>
<p>"OK, yeah, but in the grand scheme, I could've easily run into someone better than me, or the cards might not have been so friendly. It's called gambling for a reason."</p>
<p>Chris nodded, but didn't look convinced.</p>
<p>"I got a fire pit out back. You guys want to sit around the fire, maybe smoke a bowl?"</p>
<p>"Oh, hell yeah. Evenin’ ‘round the fire sounds real good." Vince grinned. "Let’s ditch these leathers. Get the gear off the bikes first."</p>
<p>"Yeah, all my shit's still on the Honda."</p>
<p>We went back out the front and collected our gear. There wasn't another option; they had to just drop it all on the floor. In my two years in this cabin, I realized that Vince and Chris were my first two guests ever. I wish I had known, so I could have cleaned up a bit.</p>
<p>We all changed out of our riding leathers into jeans.</p>
<p>"I suppose you just got an outhouse, no bathroom?" Chris said.</p>
<p>"Yeah, go out the back door, turn left. It’s about twenty yards straight into the woods. Ash bucket and shovel on the floor. If you just need to piss, just do it anywhere outside. You don't have to use the outhouse for that."</p>
<p>"Got it," Chris responded. He walked out carrying what looked like a small gym bag. I didn’t ask.</p>
<p>Vince gave me a wry grin as if he knew something I didn't.</p>
<p>"It's gonna be dark pretty quick, so I'm gonna get out there to get the fire started. You got a flashlight?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I always got one on the bike. It’s basic equipment to always have."</p>
<p>I grinned and laughed, "That's like me and my wilderness backpack. It's always ready to go. So, it's been a while since I had a fire up there. I need to grab some kindling and some larger pieces of wood. Also, I gotta take a shovel and the sand bucket. It's all in the woodshed. You help?"</p>
<p>"'course."</p>
<p>"After that, I gotta come back down, grab some stuff to eat and drink around the fire. I don't have any beer or anything like that for you."</p>
<p>"No trouble, my whiskey bottle is also basic equipment, always on the bike."</p>
<p>I thought about David's constant drinking, but I had yet to see Chris or Vince take a drink on the road.</p>
<p>Walking out the front, Vince went straight to the bikes where he pulled both his and Chris's flashlights. I used a two-C-cell bicycle headlamp as a flashlight. For himself, Vince held a huge metal D-cell flashlight. For Chris, it was a weird army-green flashlight with the bulb and lens turned ninety degrees from forward. Could be a work light with a clip; interesting idea. I had never seen such a thing. It wasn't quite dark enough to need to use them yet.</p>
<p>I don't know who originally made the fire pit. I discovered it a month after I moved in. I had to clean it up quite a bit. It's got a good circle of stones around it. They had to have hauled them in as they weren't native stone. They dug a flat spot into the hillside, like a little amphitheater, the fire ring close to the cut they made in the uphill bank. Two raised log benches formed the two strokes of a  "V"  with the fire ring, like a misplaced diacritic, in the middle. Not wood from this forest; lodgepole pines do not get that thick. They got no awards for comfort, but they worked.</p>
<p>After gathering all we needed for an evening around the fire, I settled in to lighting it. I'm an active fire tender. I start small and feed it up to the size I want. I like to tinker with it. Chris and Vince just sat on a bench watching me.</p>
<p>Vince spoke up, "You make a fire like Ben did. You started really small."</p>
<p>"Who's Ben?" I carefully leaned another one of my tinder sticks on my growing fire.</p>
<p>"Lifetime ago. Hobo out by the Northern Pacific yard in Butte. Could build a fire just big enough to warm ya, small enough to keep hid from the yard bulls."</p>
<p>I looked up at Vince expecting a story, but it didn't come. Vince passed his whiskey bottle to Chris. It's that part of dusk where the sky fades fast into night. The orange light of my fire flickered in their eyes back at me. Goddamn, but they were as sexy as hell.</p>
<p>I started placing larger pieces on, heading toward a sustaining fire so I could retire to the bench next to them.</p>
<p>Chris spoke out. "I brought some of that black hash that you liked so much yesterday. You want me to start a bowl?"</p>
<p>I turned quickly to him with a grin. "Yes, please."</p>
<p>“Always so polite, ain’t ya?” Vince gave me an amused look.</p>
<p>I sped up my additions to the fire. Once burning to my satisfaction, I stepped over to the bench and sat down next to Chris.</p>
<p>He handed me a pipe already warmed and smoking. It tasted really good. They can keep their fucking whiskey. I'd take the hash any day.</p>
<p>I passed the pipe back to Chris, and he passed it straight on to Vince. When the pipe next came back to me, neither of them wanted it back. After a couple more hits, I set it down. I was flyin'.</p>
<p>"Karl, tell me about this hill we're on. The cut in the hillside is just gravel and rocks. When we put in the cut into our hillside back at the house for the patio, we hit solid rock. Had to have it jackhammered."</p>
<p>"This is glacial moraine: all the rock garbage that the glaciers ground up and shoved around. Another name for itis till. This hill is a lateral moraine, a smaller ice sheet down the Railroad Creek Valley pushing all this gravel and rock off to the side. There's no bedrock anywhere near the surface here." I shut my eyes and started laughing.  Chris had his hand on my pants, massaging my cock.</p>
<p>I turned my head to him and met his smile. He slipped off the log onto his knees, then turned around and pushed between my legs. I saw no reason to resist. He pressed his face into my crotch, sniffing through my jeans and rubbing his cheeks and nose over my instantly rigid dick.</p>
<p>Vince turned, putting one leg on either side of the log. He moved forward, putting his right leg behind me and leaning his left one outward against my left knee. He leaned in and rubbed his face on the left side of mine. His beard tangled with my hair, and his mouth moved closer and closer until it met mine. He murmured, "You sexy fucker" before parting his lips in connection with mine.  Soon our tongues met in slippery, squirming ecstasy, tasting of his whiskey.</p>
<p>Chris started to tug at my jeans buttons. I leaned back to give him better access, but that broke my contact with Vince. He reached down to the bottom of my shirt, pulled it up, stripping it off me. I stood up to allow Chris to unbutton my jeans and push them down. Fucking boots.</p>
<p>Bit of an interruption as I shed my foot gear. Both Chris and Vince took the opportunity to strip themselves. Once all naked, we fell back together. Chris back on his knees, using his pants as knee pads, in front of me as I stood next to Vince, our mouths reunited.</p>
<p>I held my right hand on the back of Chris's head as he teased my cock with his face and mouth, while my left hand held a handful of Vince's beard and mine together. Chris then suddenly swallowed my dick, and I gasped at the sensation. Leaning my head backward, again breaking the connection with Vince, I just looked up to the sky, my hips unconsciously starting that primal humping motion. I let go of Vince's beard, placing both hands on the back of Chris's head. I started fucking his face properly.</p>
<p>All too soon, I yanked out and stood still, staring down that growing sensation in my crotch, willing it to subside. Just like that first day on the motorcycle, practicing with the brake. Trying to find that sweet spot between static and kinetic friction. Keep the bike from skidding, keep my dick from coming. I held it back, looking at these two fuckers through wild eyes.</p>
<p>Jesus, I wanted Chris's ass. I leaned over him, and my right arm reached down, as if on its own, grabbing his ass and pulling up. He stood up, but just as he did, my wood teepee in the fire pit collapsed, sending up a cloud of sparks and smoke.</p>
<p>The rational mind took control back from the body. I abruptly abandoned sex and stepped over to the wood pile, selected an appropriately sized chunk. I knelt down by the fire ring to precisely place my selection, maximizing contact with the glawing coals.</p>
<p>Standing back up, I realized I had lost my place in line. Chris stood bent over, Vince had his dick fully up his partner's ass. Not deterred, I took advantage of Chris's other end. That put him between us, with Vince and me facing each other. He leaned over toward me, and we formed a triangle: mouth to mouth, dick to mouth, dick to ass. That rational mind, the talking one, fell away into silence. The body humped on its own, taking the mind on a joyride. Time becomes incredibly elastic after getting stoned like that. I recall having to deal with the fire several times, adding logs, rearranging a collapse, or shoving unburned ends back to the middle. It became a time measurement of its own. Our sexual joyride took eight campfire tending segments and included four orgasms by firelight.</p>
<p>The last one was silly and made me laugh. Chris challenged me to see if I could arc a load of cum over the campfire. If it had been my first squirt of the evening, I could have done it. The second fell about a third of the way short.</p>
<p>It wasn't long after sex ended that it got too cool to be naked with the fire: one side too hot the other side uncomfortably cold. We dressed and then sat watching the fire slowly burn down. I offered them the only snacks I had available: dried buffalo jerky that bought from a Blackfeet rancher south of Browning. While I had packed them up to the fire ring, it felt too weird to offer them carrots. It may have been a meager snack, but to my mind, it capped the day perfectly.</p>
<p>We hiked back down to the cabin. I started the generator so we could get ourselves settled in for the night. We climbed up into my loft, pulled the mattresses off the two twin beds, and onto the floor. Not perfect accommodations for three people, but good enough.</p>
<p>Once everything was set, I went back out and killed the generator. I didn't need light to navigate back to bed.</p>
<p>For the third time with these men, I fell asleep feeling satisfied, valued, and safe. I never wanted this to end.</p>
