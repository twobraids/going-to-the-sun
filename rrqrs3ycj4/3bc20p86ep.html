<p>I woke with banging on my door—insistent—fast. Took a few seconds to remember where I was. What the noise meant. Don't think anyone has ever knocked on the door to my cabin, why should it happen here in a motel room?</p>
<p>I swung my legs off the bed—no blankets over me—annoyed I still had my boots on. That smell—turned toward the sheets—leaned in and sniffed them. Sweat. Dried cum.</p>
<p>Rook. My dick stirred.</p>
<p>The knocking repeated.</p>
<p>Didn't want to leave that scent. Goddamn it—I strode to the door and swung it open. "What do you want?"</p>
<p>Sarah stood there with her hand still in the air.  "About time."  She pushed her way into the room. Again.</p>
<p>"Didn't waste any time, did ya? First night here and you're already turning tricks."</p>
<p>I froze, my eyes trapped by her headlights—fuck, she's worse than Gladys.</p>
<p>"Rook doesn't keep his mouth shut." Her eyes drilled me. "You need to know how things work around here. I don't give a shit who you sleep with. If you're doing it for cash anywhere around the MC, the bar, or, hell, anywhere in the valley, you're doing it through me."</p>
<p>I hesitated—scared. "I didn't ask him to pay me. Thought we were just gonna have sex. I didn't even see the money on the table until after he left."</p>
<p>Her skeptical look silenced me.</p>
<p>"What'd you do with cash?"</p>
<p>Her challenge shamed me. I rose and grabbed my pack off the floor at the foot of the bed. I dug around the inside pocket, pulled out a my wad of cash—ugh, mixed in with my tips. I sorted and separated three twenties, a ten and a five, and held it out to her.</p>
<p>"So you took it even though you claim you didn't ask for it." She wielded her glare like a knife. "I don't want the money. It's yours. I just need to know about it: the amount, what you did for it. I track it all."</p>
<p>I let out an exasperated sigh. "Listen, Chris introduced Rook to me last night. I didn’t make any sort of deal with either of them."</p>
<p>"Vince says I'm misjudging you. I'm not convinced." She snorted and shook her head. "Jesus Christ, you can't just shove your dick into my territory. You're going to talk to Lonna. She's better explaining this than I am."</p>
<p>I gestured with my hand, my thumb pointing at the shared wall with the next room. "She was there last night."</p>
<p>"She doesn't spend the night with her johns. She's long gone outta there."</p>
<p>She sat up straighter and her tone of voice changed. "You start your dealing shift at 2 this afternoon, right?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Lonna will meet you in the card room about a half hour before you start dealing."</p>
<p>“This sure as hell wasn’t what I planned to talk about this morning.” She stopped, mind shifting gears fast. “Right now, you’re coming to breakfast with me. I wanna talk computers. I’ve got a stack of magazine articles and no clue what half of ‘em mean. You’re gonna straighten me out.”</p>
<p>I reeled for a moment with the change in direction.  "Ok. I'm just out of bed. I oughta shower." I looked down at my rumpled clothing. "I'm still wearing what I had on last night."</p>
<p>"Doesn't matter to me. C'mon. Let's go."</p>
<p>"Give me a chance to rebraid my hair." I let some irritation show in my voice.</p>
<p>"Do it in the car." She walked out the door, clearly expecting I'd follow close behind her.</p>
<p>I obeyed.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="FourthStreet">Fourth Street</h2>
<p>Sarah dropped me off back at the bar about 9:30. My mind filled with thoughts of computers. She wanted to buy three of them. One for her home office and two for the Iron Horse. She settled on the new IBM ATs, 286 processors, 512K of RAM—amazing.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see all the activity at the bar—so many beautiful bikes—the really old ones showing their age got my dick going—my hard-on for hardware.</p>
<p>This was the Club's church day. All the members in a meeting at the club room all morning. Whole property lock-down.</p>
<p>I had to clear out by 10—not a problem. I'd been itching for the time and excuse to walk the BN right-of-way east to see the trestle over the Flathead River. Needed some time out walking myself—process all this crap.</p>
<p>I ducked into my room and changed out of yesterday's dealer shirt & jeans into proper hiking gear, shorts and headband.  The earring got left on the table.</p>
<p>I crossed the tracks at the end of the building and turned east. From this perspective, I got the idea that this wasn't the railroad's original alignment—easy to see the remains of branching patterns in the layout of the land, not parallel with the current single track.</p>
<p>I glanced over to the Iron Horse and it hit me. Those traces line up with the four huge bay doors of the building. It wasn't a truck shop, it was an old Great Northern railcar maintenance building. I imagined gigantic block and tackle hoists from those huge wooden trusses above the card room. It made perfect sense—the connection made me grin. Vowed to look for traces of the rails in the concrete floor of the card room.</p>
<p>The tracks curved to the right just before crossing the Flathead and a control semaphore stood sentinel before the curve, a red eye staring down the tracks toward me—westbound train coming. I picked up the pace.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The trestle followed the construction pattern I hoped for, a steep gravel bank to the river, but with a level space between the abutment and the drop off. Just enough space to standup right under the tracks.</p>
<p>Never really trusted the safety of it. I couldn't stand still, paced around looking alternately between the ground and the structure of the dark creosoted soaked beams and ties above my head.</p>
<p>The rumble started. My gaze leveled with the underside the steel trusses reaching out over the river to the first concrete pier with its foot in the river—probably dated to the twenties or thirties.</p>
<p>Along with the creeks and groans of the trusses and the metallic shrieks from the rails, I felt the train getting closer and closer. The trusses flexed under the weight—subtle, but real. I figured it happened—first time I'd seen it in real life.</p>
<p>The rumble vibrated my chest, my ribs playing tuning forks in sympathetic vibration. The first SD40 drum rolled over me, the second, a syncopation in the vibration, the third brought a symphonic climax. Diesel exhaust, hot metal, dust, grease.  Goddamn, someday, I'm gonna time a jerk off a load with this—hell, imagine fucking to this rhythm.</p>
<p>Without the engines, the symphony of noise shifted to the double strokes of steel wheels on track joints, the metal-on-metal screams and the occasional bad axle bearings banging like a clockwork blacksmith.</p>
<p>After the last car squealed by, I scoped out a route down to the river, my body buzzing from the thrill. Expected I'd carry that with me for the next hour.</p>
<p>Wasn't much worse than hiking down a talus slope. The river cut a bench of glacial outwash, cross bedded, minimally sorted. The banks shrank in height as the river turned toward the US2 bridge and on to the lake.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Most of these lower banks grew riparian cottonwoods, short lived trees that left tangles of logs after floods. I made my way downstream when I heard another train. Turned in time to see the eastbound Amtrak Empire Builder, a silver and blue streak across the trestle. I calculated the time and distance—seemed about really late, accounting for distance, won't pass Railroad Creek Ranch until late afternoon—usually does it in the morning. A win for the passengers, it usually skirted Glacier Park in the dark.</p>
<p>I ate my nuts and dried fruit from my pack for lunch.</p>
<p>I hiked all the way to US2 and climbed up onto the highway. I passed  the Glacier View Motel and then on to the Iron Horse a half mile further down the highway.</p>
<h2 id="FifthStreet">Fifth Street</h2>
<p>I pulled my jeans back, but stopped before buttoning them.  Lonna's words came back from yesterday: "Sell the biker, the tokes will roll in." The jeans fell the back to the floor and I stepped out of them. Grabbed my leather riding pants, pulled them on instead.</p>
<p>I walked around back of the Horse through the open door to the card room.</p>
<p>Chris and Lonna sat in conversation over at table one. Chris spotted me approaching, gave me a grin and a terse greeting. He stood up, excused himself, and headed down the corridor to the office—like he ran away.</p>
<p>"Well, howdy, Mountain-man. Heard you had a good time last night.” Her wry smile told me she probably knew every detail. Sarah said that Rook couldn't keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p>"You and Chris talking about me?" I felt affronted.</p>
<p>"Don't be paranoid." She paused to laugh. "Of course we were talking about you. I'm getting the your story from everyone, get us all on the same page."</p>
<p>"And now you want it from me?" Pursed my lips.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0057" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"See, you're just as smart as everyone says." She pulled a pack of cigarettes and offered one to me.</p>
<p>I declined it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0059" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She nodded like I just confirmed a point and checked it on a list, then lit her smoke. After a long smoke plume aimed away from me, she said, “The rules are pretty simple. You wanna hustle on your own time, that's up to you. You can do it here from the bar, they don't take a cut, the MC has your back. Our girls bring customers into the bar. You can do that to.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0060" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Listen, I'm not looking for guys to pay me for sex. Hell, I wouldn't even know how to look for it. I've got no moral thing against it. I'm not gonna say 'no' if it falls in my lap. I need the money."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0061" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She nodded. "That's fine.  If you really want it to pay, Sarah and Chris can find johns for you—they can get you way more money. They take a cut, it's a deal that works for both you and them. Chris said he had you on the payroll yesterday afternoon in the apartment."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0062" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"This just doesn't make any sense. I don't have guys lining up. I doubt it'll ever happen again."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0063" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She grinned. "Mountain-man, you really have no idea, do yah? About time you came out of the woods and met the real world. It's everywhere."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0064" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shook my head, not believing her.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0065" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You just think about it. We can make it happen if and when you want it. From what Chris says, you're a natural at it."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0066" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I barked out a laugh. "Sex is natural thing for everyone."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0067" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No, it's a skill, you can acquire and get better at."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0068" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I knew that made sense, but I didn't want to show that I agreed. I just frowned.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0069" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You gotta start dealing. The limits table starts up in five minutes." She glanced to the cashier window that Judy had just pushed open.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0070" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah." I stood up, glad to end this conversation.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0071" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As a walked toward Judy's window, Lonna said, "The leather pants work. You need a bandana with skulls on it." I glanced back for a moment, then went on to set up my table for the midafternoon tourists.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="SixthStreet">Sixth Street</h2>
<p>The Foresters start arriving. Foresters are a rough crowd.</p>
<p>The fight between Grizz and Dragsaw of the Foresters</p>
<h2 id="SeventhStreet">Seventh Street</h2>
<p>The players of the far end of my shift had all been Foresters partying. I heard "Like playin' in Reno" several times—maybe the no limits deal didn't fly in Oregon. They drank hard, smoked heavily, and tipped outrageously—no complaints from me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0078" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>In the last half hour of my shift, Rook and a Forester with the Roseburg patch joined the rest of the guys at my table. I nodded in welcome and smiled. Rook gave a smile that shifted my dick my pants. His buddy, "Fir" on the front of his cut, looked skeptical—not sure if of me or the game.</p>
<p>He looked young, probably about my age, very dense beard, but shaved on the neck and cheeks, a shave of that useless variety: by the end of the day, it's already noticeably growing back. I admired that—would have fought it had it been mine.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0080" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I spun out the third street deal, two hole cards and the door card. I marked Fir as the low hand, so I looked to him for the bring-in. He didn't act until Rook leaned in and gave a quick prompting—Fir just tagged himself as a novice player, no limits table was not the right place for him. Fir pushed the two bucks.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0081" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The games continued and Fir's brothers showed him no mercy. They goaded him into betting wildly and he paid hard for it. Rook didn't do all that much better, repeated the same mistakes he made last night.</p>
<p>Almost lost track of the game thinking of last night with Rook. Tried not to look at him much.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0083" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Neither of them lasted more that a half dozen hands before they cashed out. Rook tipped generously, Fir gave just a buck. As they walked away, Fir looked back over his shoulder at me, a once up, down, and back up sweep of his eyes. They disappeared in the crowd out at the back patio.</p>
<hr>
<p>Like the previous night, I picked up bottle of Apple Beer, but this time I wandered out the front of the place to see the bikes. Grizz, arms folded across his chest, stood sentinel next to the proud display of Vince and Chris's choppers on either side of the front door.</p>
<p>Probably a hundred bikes crowded the lot: a line along the front of the Horse, another row out by the road, even another, including my Ironhead, along the length of the dead motel.  Several knots of riders, both Bastards and Foresters, stood around smoking, talking, laughing. I strolled by them all, the bikes and bikers. I snorted when I thought of them as snowflakes, no two alike.</p>
<p>As I walked from my room down the line, the door of the third room opened. A Forester and, what I assumed was one of Sarah's women, walked out laughing. I didn't know her name—so many names I needed to learn around here.</p>
<p>The distant rumble and turbo howl of a freight train hung in the air over the music and noise of the bar. I switched directions, heading for the tracks.</p>
<p>Eastbound train, looked to the left, the headlight pierced the growing dusk. Looking to the east, he had the green high ball, he was moving fast. The headlight illuminated the tracks, the ballast, then the crowd behind the bar. I assumed out caution, the engineer laid on the horn, a tri-tone wail of danger approaching at sixty miles per hour. Many in the crowd answered him with drunken howls and shouts of their own.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0090" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The air pressure shockwave shoved me back just before the lead engine roared past me. I stepped forward onto the ballast for my favorite rush—like cumming a second time on the same day. I turned to the east, about a minute later, the highball dropped to red as he passed the signal—don’t know why seeing the signal change gave me a thrill.</p>
<p>Another thirty seconds later, the last car whipped the wind and a cloud of stinging dust onto my face. I stepped over the near rail to watch the slow blinking red eye on the last car shrink into the distance.</p>
<p>Just a moment later, the first stab of rising moonlight pierced the forest above Bad Rock mountain. I grinned at the timing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0093" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Started back to my room to smoke a bowl.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0094" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Christ, thought you were gonna step in front of it. Railroads hate it when people do that shit."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0095" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stopped, my boot crunching the gravel on the old asphalt. Didn’t recognize the voice of the shouted rebuke, too dark to see his face, just a silhouette, as I had both the rising moon and the lights of the Horse in my eyes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0096" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Eh, I do that all the time. Love the rush.” I retorted. "You work for BN?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0097" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No, Roseburg, Umpqua and Pacific. Brakeman.” He went silent—waiting for my contrition? Fuck him, he wasn’t getting it.</p>
<p>When he spoke again, he dropped the yard bull line. “You're the dealer. Two Braids. I was at your table."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0099" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I tried make out facial features, but failed. "Ok. I can't see you worth shit in this light, so I can't say I remember you."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0100" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Fir."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0101" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Ah, near the end of my shift. You’re the Forester that came in with Rook." I walked closer to him, but to his left to force him to turn his face to the light. “Your brothers didn't cut you any slack at the table tonight.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0102" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He looked down, the brim of his cap thwarting my maneuver. "Yeah, they never do. Cost me fifty bucks."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0103" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Why'd you come to the table? You weren't into the game."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0104" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He looked up—wary eyes. "Rook pulled me in. Wanted me to see you."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0105" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Goddamn, they got me on display—fuck though, my dick got hard—that hair sticking out the top of his t-shirt.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0106" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Uh, listen, I think I need a drink. Can I buy you one?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0107" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Sure." A total setup. Jesus, Sarah and Lonna probably in on it. I had to adjust my dick in my pants. I sighed—the body wants what the body wants—like riding.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0108" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The railroad signal down the line flicked from red to amber—another eastbound train coming—I glanced down the west tracks, no sign of it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0109" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I was about to smoke a joint when you came up." I held it up for him to see. "You can join me, or I'll meet you in the bar."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0110" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He didn't hesitate in accepting. We passed the joint back and forth several times while I kept my eye on the eastbound track. We finished the joint without the second train.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0111" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I led the way back through the card room, looking for Lonna. Spotted her at a table, dealing. I made it point to scowl at her as I walked by. Thought I saw an eye glance at me, but she didn’t acknowledge me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0112" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Fir and I snagged a pair of stools together at the far end of the bar by the pool tables. Whiskey stepped up. Fir took the initiative, "Shot of tequila, and whatever he wants." He gestured to me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0113" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked to Whiskey with a skeptical eye. "I don't drink. What can you give me in a shot glass?"</p>
<p>Whiskey stared at me for a moment then smiled with a nod. "Got you covered."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0115" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We sat there in silence. Fir stared at the polished wood of the bar.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0116" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Whiskey returned. Transparent tequila for Fir, a cloudy brown liquid for me.  Fir passed Whiskey some cash. I picked up my shot and sniffed. Ginger hot, but acidic too, vinegary.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0117" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I held my glass up to Fir—trust your bartender. He raised his and we downed our shots—vinegar sting, then a ginger blast to my sinuses, followed by a building cayenne fire. I broke out laughing—three distinct phases—a programmed drink—nothing like it in my experience.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0118" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"What did he give you?" Fir looked at me like I confused him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0119" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Whiskey brought Fir's change. As he reached for it, I spotted the wedding band on Fir’s hand.</p>
<p>Whiskey looked at me with a slight tip to his head.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0121" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I answered his unasked question. "Loved it. A buzz-burn with a different chemical. What was it?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0122" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Secret recipe. I gotta lot more ideas." He winked at me and strode back down the bar to serve another customer.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0123" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned back to Fir and shrugged.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0124" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He looked at me with his eyes. "You don't drink?" He paused, brows furrowed looking at me. "I really don't get who or what you are."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0125" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Don’t anyone around here could answer that." I snorted. "How long you known Rook?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0126" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He shrugged. "This is my third run through here. We met that first time. We..."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0127" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Lonna interrupted him by stepping up and putting an arm over my shoulder. "Oh, who's your handsome friend, Mountain-man?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0128" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Two huge breasts blocked most of my view of Fir as Lonna stepped between us. I leaned on the bar to see around her.  "This is Lonna. She's a whore. Lonna, this is Fir the Forester."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0129" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She looked at me for just a second. "You're fun." She took a step back.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0130" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Fir's eyes fixated on her tits—deer caught by the high beams.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0131" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“I think she might be my handler tonight." I frowned. "Or whatever the right term is."</p>
<p>"Sorry for interrupting you boys." She looked at me hard. "And you're right, I am your handler."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0133" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She looked to Fir, put a hand on his shoulder. "Listen, you just tell him what you want, and Two Braids the mountain man will make it happen." She dropped her other hand on my shoulder. "You boys play nice tonight." She turned and sauntered away toward the card room, the greedy eyes of many hungry Foresters tracking her boobs.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0134" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My palm and my forehead met at the halfway point—what was the point of that? "Jesus fucking Christ. Let's get out of this carnival."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0135" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I popped off the seat, head gestured to Fir to follow, and headed to the front door. A quick glance back confirmed he got the message.</p>
<p>Outside, illuminated by the Horse’s neon and the moon hanging over Bad Rock, I missed colliding with Grizz by inches. I didn't give him a chance, powered right past him. I expected a comment, but didn't hear one.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0137" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Fir caught up to me. "I got a hotel room a few blocks away."</p>
<p>"Glacier View?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0140" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Of course it is." I huffed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0141" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Illuminated by the bar's neon, I pointed to the sidewalk cut at the the motel end of the lot. "I'll meet you at that exit"  I walked straight to the IronHead, fired it up.  Waited with the engine vibrating my balls until I saw a headlight swing across the lot and then circle toward me. I pulled out to the highway.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0142" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We rode together to the Glacier View.</p>
