            <h2 id="ThirdStreet">Third Street</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I woke with banging on my door—insistent—fast. Took a few seconds to remember where I was. What the noise meant. Don't think anyone has ever knocked on the door to my cabin.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I swung my legs off the bed—nothing over me—annoyed I still had my boots on. That smell—turned toward the sheets—leaned in and sniffed them. Sweat. Dried cum.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rook. My dick stirred.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The knocking repeated.</p>
<p>Didn't want to leave that scent. Goddamn it—I strode to the door and swung it open. "What do you want?"</p>
<p>Sarah stood there with her hand still in the air.  "About time."  She pushed her way into the room. Again.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Didn't waste any time, did ya? First night here and you're already turning tricks."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I froze, my eyes trapped by her headlights—fuck, she's worse than Gladys.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Rook doesn't ever keep his mouth shut." Her eyes drilled me. "You need to know how things work around here. I don't give a shit who you sleep with. If you're doing it for cash anywhere around the MC, the bar, or, hell, anywhere in the valley, you're doing it through me."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I hesitated—scared. "I didn't ask him to pay me. Thought we were just gonna have sex. I didn't even see the money on the table until after he left."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Her skeptical look silenced me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"What'd you do with cash?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Her challenge shamed me. I rose and grabbed my pack off the floor at the foot of the bed. I dug around the inside pocket, pulled out a my wad of cash—ugh, mixed in with my tips. I sorted and separated three twenties, a ten and a five, and held it out to her.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I don't want it. It's yours. I just need to know about it: the amount, what you did for it. I track it all."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I let out an exasperated sigh. "Listen, Chris introduced Rook to me last night. I didn’t make any sort of deal with either of them."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Vince says I'm misjudging you. I'm not convinced." She snorted and shook her head. "This isn't at all what I expected to talk to you about this morning. I want you to get together with Lonna. She's better at this than I am."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I gestured with my hand, my thumb pointing at the shared wall with the next room. "She was there last night."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"She doesn't ever spend the night with her johns. She's long gone outta there."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She sat up straighter and her tone of voice changed. "You start your dealing shift at 2 this afternoon, right?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I nodded.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I'll have Lonna talk with you about a half hour before you start dealing."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She paused, switching gears again. "Right now, you're coming to breakfast with me. I wanna talk about my computer projects. I've got a dozen magazine articles and I need you to explain 'em, get me on the right track."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Ok. I'm just out of bed. I oughta shower." I looked down at my rumpled clothing. "I'm still wearing what I had on last night."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Doesn't matter to me. C'mon. Let's go."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Give me a chance to rebraid my hair." I let some irritation out.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Do it in the car." She walked out the door, clearly expecting I'd follow close behind her.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I did.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="FourthStreet">Fourth Street</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Sarah dropped me off at the bar about 9:30. My mind filled with thoughts of computers. She wanted to buy three of them. One for her home office and two for the Iron Horse. She wants the new IBM ATs, 286 processors, 512K of RAM—amazing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I was surprised to see all the activity at the bar—so many beautiful bikes—the really old ones showing their age earned my smile.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>This was the Club's church day. All the members in a meeting at the club room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I had to clear out by 10. Not allowed on Club property during church—so strange. Not a problem, either. I'd been itching for the time and excuse to walk the BN right of way east to see the trestle over the Flathead River.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I ducked into my room and changed out of yesterday's dealer shirt & jeans into proper hiking gear, shorts and headband.  The earring got left on the table.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I crossed the tracks at the end of the building and turned east. From this perspective, I got the idea that this wasn't the railroad's original alignment—easy to see the remains of branching patterns in the layout of the land, not parallel with the current single track.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I glanced over to the Iron Horse and it hit me. Those traces line up with the four huge bay door of the building. It wasn't a truck shop, it was a railcar maintenance building. It made perfect sense—the connection made me grin.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The tracks curved to the right just before crossing the Flathead and a control semaphore stood sentinel before the curve, a red eye staring down toward me—westbound train coming. I picked up the pace.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The trestle followed the pattern I hoped for, a steep gravel bank to the river, but with a level space between the abutment and the drop off. Just enough space to standup right under the tracks.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Never really trusted the safety of it. I couldn't stand still, paced around looking alternately between the ground and the structure of the acrid creosoted beams and ties above my head.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The rumble started. My gaze leveled with the underside the steel trusses reaching out over the river to the first concrete pier with its foot in the river—probably dated to the twenties or thirties.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>By the creeks and groans of the metal and the metallic shrieks from the rails, I felt the train getting closer and closer. The trusses flexed under the weight—subtle, but real. I figured it happened—first time I'd seen it in real life.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The rumble vibrated my chest, my ribs tuning forks in sympathetic vibration. The first SD40 drum rolled over me, the second, a syncopation in the vibration, the third brought a symphonic climax. Diesel exhaust, hot metal, dust, grease.  Goddamn, someday, I'm gonna time a jerk off a load with this—hell, imagine fucking to this rhythm.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Without the engines, the rest of the train decrescendoed to just the metal screams and the occasional bad axle bearings banging like clockwork blacksmith hammers.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After the last car squealed by, I scoped out a route down to the river, giddy with the thrill. Expected I'd carry that with me for the next hour.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Wasn't much worse than hiking down a talus slope. The river cut a bench of glacial outwash, cross bedded, largely unsorted. The banks shrank as the river turned toward the US2 bridge and on to the lake.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Most of these lower banks wore riparian cottonwoods, short lived trees that leave tangles of logs. I made my way downstream when I heard another train. Turned in time to see the eastbound Amtrak Empire Builder, a silver and blue streak across the trestle. I calculated the time and distance—seemed about five hours late, accounting for distance, won't pass Railroad Creek Ranch until late afternoon—usually noon. A treat for the passengers, it usually skirted Glacier Park at night.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I ate my nuts and dried fruit from my pack for lunch.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0048" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I hiked all the way to US2 and climbed up onto the highway. I passed  the Glacier View Motel and then on to the Iron Horse a half mile further down the highway.</p>
<h2 id="FifthStreet">Fifth Street</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0050" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pulled my jeans back, but stopped before buttoning them.  Lonna's words came back from yesterday: "Sell the biker, the tokes will roll in." The jeans fell the back to the floor and I stepped out of them. Grabbed my leather riding pants, pulled them on instead.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0051" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I walked around back of the Horse through the open door to the card room long.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0052" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris and Lonna sat in conversation over at table one. Chris spotted me approaching, gave me a grin and a terse greeting. He stood up, excused himself, and headed down the corridor to the office—like he's running away.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Well, howdy, Mountain-man. Heard you had a good time last night.” Her wry smile told me she probably knew every detail. Sarah said that Rook couldn't keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0054" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You and Chris talking about me?" I felt affronted.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Don't be paranoid." She paused to laugh. "Of course we were talking about you. I'm getting the your story from everyone, get us all on the same page."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0056" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"And now you want it from me?" Pursed my lips.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0057" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"See, you're just as smart as everyone thinks." She pulled a pack of cigarettes and offered one to me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I declined it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0059" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She nodded like I just confirmed a point and checked it on a list.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0060" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I told her a story. “When I was in high school, my friends were always trying to get alcohol, anything they could get their hands on. I had no interest, but I saw a saw an opportunity. Once they got their beer, they needed a place to keep it. I kept it for them. Every time they wanted access to it, I charged five bucks. Later in the school year, I used the money to get a programable calculator to use in my physics class.”</p>
<h2 id="SixthStreet">Sixth Street</h2>
<p>The Foresters start arriving. Foresters are a rough crowd.</p>
<p>The fight between Grizz and Dragsaw of the Foresters</p>
<h2 id="SeventhStreet">Seventh Street</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0065" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The players of the far end of my shift had all been Foresters partying. I heard "Like playin' in Reno" several times—maybe the no limits deal didn't fly in Oregon. They drank hard, smoked heavily,  and  tipped outrageously—no complaints from me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0066" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>In the last half hour, Rook and a Forester with the Roseburg patch joined the rest of the guys at my table. I nodded in welcome and smiled. Rook gave a smile that shifted my dick my pants. His buddy, "Furr" on the front of his cut, looked skeptical—not sure if of me or the game.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0067" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He looked young, probably about my age, very dense beard, but shaved on the next and cheeks, a shave of that useless variety by the end of the day because it's already noticeably growing back. I admired that.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0068" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I spun out the third street deal. I marked Furr as the low hand showing, so looked to him for the bring-in. He didn't act until Rook leaned in and gave a quick prompting—Furr's a novice player, might not want to be at the no limits table. Furr pushed the two bucks.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0069" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The game continued and Furr's brothers did not show him mercy. They goaded him into betting wildly and Furr paid hard for it. Rook didn't do all that much better, repeated the same mistakes he made last night.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0070" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Almost lost track of the game thinking of last night with Rook. Tried not to look at him much.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0071" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Neither of them lasted more that a half dozen hands before they cashed out. Rook tipped generously, Furr gave just a buck. As they walked away, Furr looked back over his shoulder at me, a once up, down, and back up sweep of his eyes. They disappeared in the crowd out at the back patio.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0073" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Like the previous night, I picked up bottle of Apple Beer, but this time I wandered out the front of the place to see the bikes. Grizz, arms folded across his chest, stood sentinel next to the proud display of Vince and Chris's choppers on either side of the front door.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0074" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Probably a hundred bikes crowded the lot: a line along the front, another row out by the road, even another, including my Ironhead, along the length of the dead motel.  Several knots of riders, both Bastards and Foresters, stood around smoking, talking, laughing. I strolled by them all, the bikes and bikers. I snorted when I thought of them as snowflakes, no two alike.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0075" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As I walked along the line of rooms, one of the doors opened. A Forester and, what I assumed was one of Sarah's women, walked out laughing. I didn't know her name—so many names I needed to learn around here.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0076" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The distant rumble and turbo howl of a freight train hung in the air over the music and noise of the bar. I switched directions, heading for the tracks.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0077" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Eastbound train, looked to the left, the headlight pierced the growing dusk. Looking to the east, he had the green high ball, moving fast. The headlight illuminated the tracks, the ballast, then the crowd behind the bar. I assumed out caution, the engineer laid on the horn, a tri-tone wail of danger at probably sixty miles per hour. Many in the crowded answered in drunken howls and shouts of their own.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0078" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I felt the air pressure shockwave the instant before the lead engine rocketed past me. I stepped forward onto the ballast for my favorite rush. I turned to the east, as about a minute later, the engineers highball dropped to red as he passed the signal—don’t know why seeing signal change gives me a thrill.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0079" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Another thirty seconds later, the last car whipped the wind and a cloud of stinging dust onto my face. I stepped over the near rail to watch the slow blinking red eye on the last car shrink into the distance.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0080" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Just a moment later, the first stab of rising moonlight pierced the forest above Bad Rock mountain. I grinned at the timing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0081" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned to walk back to my room, but startled to find a guy approaching me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0082" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Christ, thought you were gonna step in front of it. Railroads hate it when people do that shit." Didn’t recognize the voice of the rebuke, too dark to see his face as I faced both the rising moon and the lights of the Horse.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0083" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Eh, I do that all the time. Love the rush.” I retorted. "You work for BN?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0084" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Roseburg, Umpqua and Pacific. I'm a brakeman."</p>
