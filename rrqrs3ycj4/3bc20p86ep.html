            <h2 id="ThirdStreet">Third Street</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I woke with banging on my door—insistent—fast. Took a few seconds to remember where I was. What the noise meant. Don't think anyone has ever knocked on the door to my cabin, why should it happen here in a motel room?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I swung my legs off the bed—no blankets over me—annoyed I still had my boots on. That smell—turned toward the sheets—leaned in and sniffed them. Sweat. Dried cum.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rook. My dick stirred.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The knocking repeated.</p>
<p>Didn't want to leave that scent. Goddamn it—I strode to the door and swung it open. "What do you want?"</p>
<p>Sarah stood there with her hand still in the air.  "About time."  She pushed her way into the room. Again.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Didn't waste any time, did ya? First night here and you're already turning tricks."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I froze, my eyes trapped by her headlights—fuck, she's worse than Gladys.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Rook doesn't keep his mouth shut." Her eyes drilled me. "You need to know how things work around here. I don't give a shit who you sleep with. If you're doing it for cash anywhere around the MC, the bar, or, hell, anywhere in the valley, you're doing it through me."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I hesitated—scared. "I didn't ask him to pay me. Thought we were just gonna have sex. I didn't even see the money on the table until after he left."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Her skeptical look silenced me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"What'd you do with cash?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Her challenge shamed me. I rose and grabbed my pack off the floor at the foot of the bed. I dug around the inside pocket, pulled out a my wad of cash—ugh, mixed in with my tips. I sorted and separated three twenties, a ten and a five, and held it out to her.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"So you took it even though you claim you didn't ask for it." She wielded her glare like a knife. "I don't want the money. It's yours. I just need to know about it: the amount, what you did for it. I track it all."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I let out an exasperated sigh. "Listen, Chris introduced Rook to me last night. I didn’t make any sort of deal with either of them."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Vince says I'm misjudging you. I'm not convinced." She snorted and shook her head. "Jesus Christ, you can't just shove your dick into my territory. You're going to talk to Lonna. She's better explaining this than I am."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I gestured with my hand, my thumb pointing at the shared wall with the next room. "She was there last night."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"She doesn't spend the night with her johns. She's long gone outta there."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She sat up straighter and her tone of voice changed. "You start your dealing shift at 2 this afternoon, right?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I nodded.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Lonna will meet you in the card room about a half hour before you start dealing."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“This sure as hell wasn’t what I planned to talk about this morning.” She stopped, mind shifting gears fast. “Right now, you’re coming to breakfast with me. I wanna talk computers. I’ve got a stack of magazine articles and no clue what half of ‘em mean. You’re gonna straighten me out.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I reeled for a moment with the change in direction.  "Ok. I'm just out of bed. I oughta shower." I looked down at my rumpled clothing. "I'm still wearing what I had on last night."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Doesn't matter to me. C'mon. Let's go."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Give me a chance to rebraid my hair." I let some irritation show in my voice.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Do it in the car." She walked out the door, clearly expecting I'd follow close behind her.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I obeyed.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="FourthStreet">Fourth Street</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Sarah dropped me off back at the bar about 9:30. My mind filled with thoughts of computers. She wanted to buy three of them. One for her home office and two for the Iron Horse. She settled on the new IBM ATs, 286 processors, 512K of RAM—amazing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I was surprised to see all the activity at the bar—so many beautiful bikes—the really old ones showing their age got my dick going—my hard-on for hardware.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>This was the Club's church day. All the members in a meeting at the club room all morning. Whole property lock-down.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I had to clear out by 10—not a problem. I'd been itching for the time and excuse to walk the BN right-of-way east to see the trestle over the Flathead River. Needed some time out walking myself—process all this crap.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I ducked into my room and changed out of yesterday's dealer shirt & jeans into proper hiking gear, shorts and headband.  The earring got left on the table.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I crossed the tracks at the end of the building and turned east. From this perspective, I got the idea that this wasn't the railroad's original alignment—easy to see the remains of branching patterns in the layout of the land, not parallel with the current single track.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I glanced over to the Iron Horse and it hit me. Those traces line up with the four huge bay doors of the building. It wasn't a truck shop, it was an old Great Northern railcar maintenance building. I imagined gigantic block and tackle hoists from those huge wooden trusses above the card room. It made perfect sense—the connection made me grin. Vowed to look for traces of the rails in the concrete floor of the card room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The tracks curved to the right just before crossing the Flathead and a control semaphore stood sentinel before the curve, a red eye staring down the tracks toward me—westbound train coming. I picked up the pace.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The trestle followed the pattern I hoped for, a steep gravel bank to the river, but with a level space between the abutment and the drop off. Just enough space to standup right under the tracks.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Never really trusted the safety of it. I couldn't stand still, paced around looking alternately between the ground and the structure of the dark creosoted soaked beams and ties above my head.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The rumble started. My gaze leveled with the underside the steel trusses reaching out over the river to the first concrete pier with its foot in the river—probably dated to the twenties or thirties.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Along with the creeks and groans of the trusses and the metallic shrieks from the rails, I felt the train getting closer and closer. The trusses flexed under the weight—subtle, but real. I figured it happened—first time I'd seen it in real life.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The rumble vibrated my chest, my ribs playing tuning forks in sympathetic vibration. The first SD40 drum rolled over me, the second, a syncopation in the vibration, the third brought a symphonic climax. Diesel exhaust, hot metal, dust, grease.  Goddamn, someday, I'm gonna time a jerk off a load with this—hell, imagine fucking to this rhythm.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Without the engines, the symphony of noise shifted to the double strokes of steel wheels on track joints, the metal-on-metal screams and the occasional bad axle bearings banging like a clockwork blacksmith.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After the last car squealed by, I scoped out a route down to the river, my body buzzing from the thrill. Expected I'd carry that with me for the next hour.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Wasn't much worse than hiking down a talus slope. The river cut a bench of glacial outwash, cross bedded, minimally sorted. The banks shrank in height as the river turned toward the US2 bridge and on to the lake.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Most of these lower banks grew riparian cottonwoods, short lived trees that left tangles of logs after floods. I made my way downstream when I heard another train. Turned in time to see the eastbound Amtrak Empire Builder, a silver and blue streak across the trestle. I calculated the time and distance—seemed about five hours late, accounting for distance, won't pass Railroad Creek Ranch until late afternoon—usually does it noon. A win for the passengers, it usually skirted Glacier Park in the dark.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I ate my nuts and dried fruit from my pack for lunch.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0048" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I hiked all the way to US2 and climbed up onto the highway. I passed  the Glacier View Motel and then on to the Iron Horse a half mile further down the highway.</p>
<h2 id="FifthStreet">Fifth Street</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0050" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pulled my jeans back, but stopped before buttoning them.  Lonna's words came back from yesterday: "Sell the biker, the tokes will roll in." The jeans fell the back to the floor and I stepped out of them. Grabbed my leather riding pants, pulled them on instead.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0051" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I walked around back of the Horse through the open door to the card room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0052" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris and Lonna sat in conversation over at table one. Chris spotted me approaching, gave me a grin and a terse greeting. He stood up, excused himself, and headed down the corridor to the office—like he ran away.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Well, howdy, Mountain-man. Heard you had a good time last night.” Her wry smile told me she probably knew every detail. Sarah said that Rook couldn't keep his mouth shut.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0054" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You and Chris talking about me?" I felt affronted.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Don't be paranoid." She paused to laugh. "Of course we were talking about you. I'm getting the your story from everyone, get us all on the same page."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0056" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"And now you want it from me?" Pursed my lips.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0057" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"See, you're just as smart as everyone thinks." She pulled a pack of cigarettes and offered one to me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I declined it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0059" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She nodded like I just confirmed a point and checked it on a list.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0060" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I told her a story. “When I was in high school, my friends were always trying to get alcohol, anything they could get their hands on. I had no interest, but I saw a saw an opportunity. Once they got their beer, they needed a place to keep it. I kept it for them. Every time they wanted access to it, I charged five bucks. Later in the school year, I used the money to get a programable calculator to use in my physics class.”</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0062" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I don't think you understand how you look."</p>
<h2 id="SixthStreet">Sixth Street</h2>
<p>The Foresters start arriving. Foresters are a rough crowd.</p>
<p>The fight between Grizz and Dragsaw of the Foresters</p>
<h2 id="SeventhStreet">Seventh Street</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0067" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The players of the far end of my shift had all been Foresters partying. I heard "Like playin' in Reno" several times—maybe the no limits deal didn't fly in Oregon. They drank hard, smoked heavily, and tipped outrageously—no complaints from me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0068" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>In the last half hour of my shift, Rook and a Forester with the Roseburg patch joined the rest of the guys at my table. I nodded in welcome and smiled. Rook gave a smile that shifted my dick my pants. His buddy, "Furr" on the front of his cut, looked skeptical—not sure if of me or the game.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0069" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He looked young, probably about my age, very dense beard, but shaved on the neck and cheeks, a shave of that useless variety: by the end of the day, it's already noticeably growing back. I admired that—would have fought it had it been mine.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0070" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I spun out the third street deal, two hole cards and the door card. I marked Furr as the low hand showing, so I looked to him for the bring-in. He didn't act until Rook leaned in and gave a quick prompting—Furr just tagged himself as a novice player, no limits table was not the right place for him. Furr pushed the two bucks.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0071" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The games continued and Furr's brothers showed him no mercy. They goaded him into betting wildly and he paid hard for it. Rook didn't do all that much better, repeated the same mistakes he made last night.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0072" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Almost lost track of the game thinking of last night with Rook. Tried not to look at him much.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0073" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Neither of them lasted more that a half dozen hands before they cashed out. Rook tipped generously, Furr gave just a buck. As they walked away, Furr looked back over his shoulder at me, a once up, down, and back up sweep of his eyes. They disappeared in the crowd out at the back patio.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0075" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Like the previous night, I picked up bottle of Apple Beer, but this time I wandered out the front of the place to see the bikes. Grizz, arms folded across his chest, stood sentinel next to the proud display of Vince and Chris's choppers on either side of the front door.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0076" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Probably a hundred bikes crowded the lot: a line along the front of the Horse, another row out by the road, even another, including my Ironhead, along the length of the dead motel.  Several knots of riders, both Bastards and Foresters, stood around smoking, talking, laughing. I strolled by them all, the bikes and bikers. I snorted when I thought of them as snowflakes, no two alike.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0077" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As I walked from my room down the line, the door of the third room opened. A Forester and, what I assumed was one of Sarah's women, walked out laughing. I didn't know her name—so many names I needed to learn around here.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0078" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The distant rumble and turbo howl of a freight train hung in the air over the music and noise of the bar. I switched directions, heading for the tracks.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0079" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Eastbound train, looked to the left, the headlight pierced the growing dusk. Looking to the east, he had the green high ball, he was moving fast. The headlight illuminated the tracks, the ballast, then the crowd behind the bar. I assumed out caution, the engineer laid on the horn, a tri-tone wail of danger approaching at sixty miles per hour. Many in the crowd answered him with drunken howls and shouts of their own.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0080" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I felt the air pressure shockwave the instant before the lead engine rocketed past me. I stepped forward onto the ballast for my favorite rush—like cumming a second time on the same day. I turned to the east, as about a minute later, the highball dropped to red as he passed the signal—don’t know why seeing the signal change gives me a thrill.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0081" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Another thirty seconds later, the last car whipped the wind and a cloud of stinging dust onto my face. I stepped over the near rail to watch the slow blinking red eye on the last car shrink into the distance.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0082" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Just a moment later, the first stab of rising moonlight pierced the forest above Bad Rock mountain. I grinned at the timing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0083" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned to walk back to my room, but startled to find a guy approaching me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0084" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Christ, thought you were gonna step in front of it. Railroads hate it when people do that shit." Didn’t recognize the voice of the rebuke, too dark to see his face as I had both the rising moon and the lights of the Horse in my eyes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0085" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Eh, I do that all the time. Love the rush.” I retorted. "You work for BN?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0086" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No, Roseburg, Umpqua and Pacific. Brakeman.” He fell silent—waiting for my contrition? Fuck him, he wasn’t getting it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0087" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When he spoke again, he dropped the yard bull line. “You're the dealer. Two Braids. I was at your table."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0088" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Ok. I can't see you worth shit in this light, so I can't say I remember you."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0089" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Furr."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0090" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Ah, right at the end. You came in with Rook. Your brothers didn't cut you any slack at the table tonight."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0091" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah, they never do."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0092" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Why'd you come to the table? You didn't really look like you wanted to play poker."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0093" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Rook said I ought to get to know you."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0094" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Kind of a rotten time to do that. I was working. Not like I had time to chat."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0095" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah, I saw that. Cost me fifty bucks. Uh, listen, I think I need a shot. Can I buy you a drink?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0096" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Sure." A setup—Rook planned this. Jesus, Sarah and Lonna probably in on it. Too much at once, what the fuck would I drink?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0097" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The railroad signal flicked from red to amber—another eastbound train coming—I glanced down the west tracks, no sign of it. I sighed—back into the crowd and noise.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0098" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He led the way back through the card room. I spotted Lonna at her table, I made it point to scowl at her as I walked by. She didn’t acknowledge me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0099" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Furr and I snagged a pair of stools together at the far end of the bar by the pool tables. Whiskey stepped up. Furr took the initiative, "Shot of tequila, and whatever he wants." He gestured to me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0100" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked to Whiskey with a skeptical eye. "What can you give a guy that doesn't drink in a shot glass?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0101" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Whiskey stared at me for a moment then smiled with a nod. "Got you covered."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0102" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We sat there in silence while Furr seemed to chew on something in his head. He stared at the polished wood of the bar top.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0103" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Whiskey returned. Transparent tequila for Furr, a cloudy brown liquid for me.  Furr passed Whiskey some cash. I picked up my shot and sniffed. Ginger hot, but acidic too, vinegary.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0104" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>With a what-the-hell upward flick of my eyes, I held my glass up to Furr. He raised his and we downed our shots—vinegar sting, then a ginger blast to my sinuses, followed by a building cayenne fire—brilliant experience, three distinct phases—a programmed drink—nothing like it in my experience.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0105" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Whiskey brought Furr's change. As he reached for it, I spotted the wedding band on Furr’s hand.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0106" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Whiskey looked at me with a slight tip to his head.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0107" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I answered his unasked question. "That was amazing. I didn't know anything like that existed."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0108" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I gotta lot more." He winked at me and strode back down the bar to serve another customer.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0109" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned back to Furr.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0110" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He looked at me with troubled eyes, something like longing, confusion, and, fear? "You don't drink?" He paused, brows furrowed looking at me. "I really don't get who or what you are."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0111" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You're in the same boat as everybody in this bar." I snorted. "Including me."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0112" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He started to speak but Lonna interrupted him by stepping up behind me. "Oh, who's your handsome friend, Mountain-man?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0113" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Two huge breasts blocked most of my view of Furr as Lonna stepped between us. I leaned on the bar to see around her.  "This is Lonna. She's a whore. Lonna, this is Furr the Forester."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0114" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She shot me a devilish look and stepped back. Furr's eyes fixated on her tits—deer caught by the  high beams.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0115" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Don’t worry, she does that to me, too. I think she might be my handler tonight." I frowned. "Or whatever the right term is."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0116" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Sorry for interrupting you boys." She looked at me hard. "And you're right, I am your handler."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0117" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She looked to Furr, put a hand on his shoulder. "Listen, you just tell him what you want, and Two Braids the mountain man will make it happen." She dropped her other hand on my shoulder. "You boys play nice tonight." She turned and sauntered away toward the card room, the greedy eyes of many hungry Foresters tracking her boobs.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0118" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My palm and my forehead met at the halfway point—what was the point of that. "Jesus fucking Christ. Let's get out of this carnival."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0119" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I popped off the seat, beckoned Furr to follow and headed to the front door. A quick glance back confirmed he got the message.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0120" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Outside, illuminated by the Horse’s neon and the moon hanging over Bad Rock, I missed colliding with Grizz by inches. I didn't give him a chance, powered right past him. I expected a comment, but didn't hear one.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0121" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Furr caught up to me. "I got a hotel room a few blocks away."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0122" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Glacier View?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0123" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0124" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Of course it is. I'll meet you at that exit out of the lot." I pointed to the sidewalk cut by at the front end of motel."  I walked straight to the IronHead, unlocked it and mounted.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0125" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I waited until I saw a headlight swing across the lot and then circle toward me. I started the bike and pulled out.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0126" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We rode together to the motel.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0127" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He led me to his room.</p>
