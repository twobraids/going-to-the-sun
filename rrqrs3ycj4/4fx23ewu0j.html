            <h2 id="GoingtoTheSunRoad">Going to The Sun Road</h2>
<p>Big horn sheep made me late. Right around Oblene bend, blocking both lanes of the road. They wouldn’t move. Traffic backed up in both directions. Ten cars in front of me and at least twenty behind me. Every so often a few sheep would ascend up the mountain and just as many would drop back down onto the road way.  Probably took forty minutes to get the road cleared and that put me way behind schedule.</p>
<p>Once out of the park, I could push the speed limit. Yeah, in that twelve mile Belton to Hungry Horse run, pushing the limit meant forty. I really flew through Back Rock Canyon, still gonna roll up to the Iron Horse a half hour later than I wanted. I had a four to midnight dealing shift that night.</p>
<h2 id="TheIronHorse">The Iron Horse</h2>
<p>My heart leapt to my throat when I turned that last corner to the Horse. It was gone. Just a hollow rectangle of brick walls, darkened with soot. Daylight though the glassless windows displayed blackened wooden beams criss crossing each other from the collapsed roof.</p>
<p>This didn’t just happen. Everything was dry, I could see where rivers of firehose runoff had floated cinders into the street. This happened days ago. No fire fighters around, no cops, nobody to tell me what happened.</p>
<p>I began to tremble.</p>
<p>I needed to call Vince and Chris. I scanned the street for phone booths—nothing—I survey the bones of the Horse and my eyes started to tear up—slammed the bike into first and started back to the road. A battered notepad on the asphalt caught my eye and I stopped abruptly  popping off the bike as if spring loaded. A spiral bound notepad had been run over, crushed the spiral bindings flat. I picked it up, bent it to see the pages—smiling faces drawn in pencil of people I knew and loved—one of Dolph's notepads.  I stuck it in the breast pocket of my jacket and jumped back onto the bike.</p>
<h2 id="Whitefish">Whitefish</h2>
<p>I tore down the road, spotting a phone booth in front of the decrepit old Rexall Drug. I jumped the bike up the curb and set the side stand down on the sidewalk. No goddamn phone book.</p>
<p>I jumped back on the bike—I’d just have to go to their house—I rode like a madman to Whitefish, then turned south on US93 South—pulled off on a side road and the followed a maze of turns to their dirt road. I made the turn, but skidded to a stop as bright yellow tape, fluttering feebly in the breeze, blocked the dirt driveway: "CRIME SCENE - DO NOT CROSS."</p>
<p>I jumped off the bike, ducked under the tape and ran up the road, fearing what I'd find. Worse than I imagined—the tall stone chimney stood sentinel over the blacked rubble. Only the outline of the house remained, the furniture still sat around the stone table on the patio as if waiting for lunch. Tears blurred my vision.</p>
<p>The metal motorcycle shop, formerly obscured by the house, seemed intact. As I stepped closer, my teary eyes focused on the spray painted tags, "Burn the fags."</p>
<p>I turned away and ran back down the road.</p>
