            </div>
                  
            <h2 id="GoingtoTheSunRoad">Going to The Sun Road</h2>
<p>Big horn sheep made me late. Right around Oblene bend, blocking both lanes of the road. They wouldn’t move. Traffic backed up in both directions. Ten cars in front of me and at least twenty behind me. Every so often a few sheep would ascend up the mountain and just as many would drop back down onto the road way.  Probably took forty minutes to get the road cleared and that put me way behind schedule.</p>
<p>Once out of the park, I could push the speed limit. Yeah, in that twelve mile Belton to Hungry Horse run, pushing the limit meant forty.</p>
<p>Just like always, I flew through Back Rock Canyon at top speed—gettin' high from the thrill of the curves.</p>
<p>Still gonna roll up to the Iron Horse a half hour later than I wanted. I had a four to midnight dealing shift to get to.</p>
<h2 id="TheIronHorse">The Iron Horse</h2>
<p>My heart leapt to my throat when I turned that last corner to the Horse. It was gone. Just a hollow rectangle of brick walls, darkened with soot. Daylight though the glassless windows displayed blackened wooden beams criss crossing each other from the collapsed roof. The blackened bones of more than a half dozen motorcycles, some still on their side stands, stood guard along the front.</p>
<p>Wait, that's Vince's chopper by the front door—one of the fish tail pipes flat on the asphalt, the other sagging to the side at the wrong angle—like they melted. He loved that bike—the one with the noisy pushrods—he built it himself—he's probably so pissed. All blackened like that, I just had to look away.</p>
<p>This didn’t just happen. Everything was dry, I traced where rivers of firehose runoff had floated cinders into the street. This happened days ago. No fire fighters around, no cops, nobody to tell me what happened.</p>
<p>I began to tremble.</p>
<p>I needed to call Vince and Chris. I scanned the street for phone booths—nothing. I looked back to the shell of the Horse and the burnt corpse of Vince's chopper—my eyes started watering.</p>
<p>The bike bucked as I slammed it into first, aiming back at the road. A battered notepad on the asphalt caught my eye and I stopped with a short skid, then popping off the bike as if spring loaded. A tire track over a spiral bound notepad, the copper bindings crushed flat, the pages fanned out like a deck of cards. I picked it up, bent it to see the pages—pencil sketches of smiling faces—people I knew and loved—one of Dolph's notepads.  I stuck it in the breast pocket of my jacket and jumped back onto the bike.</p>
<h2 id="Whitefish">Whitefish</h2>
<p>I tore down the road, spotting a phone booth in front of the decrepit old Rexall Drug. I jumped the bike up the curb and set the side stand down on the sidewalk. No goddamn phone book.</p>
<p>I jumped back on the bike—I’d just have to go to their house—I rode like a madman to Whitefish, then turned south on US93—pulled off on a side road and the followed a maze of turns to their dirt road. I made the turn, but skidded to a stop as bright yellow tape, fluttering feebly in the breeze, blocked the dirt driveway: "CRIME SCENE - DO NOT CROSS."</p>
<p>I jumped off the bike, ducked under the tape and ran up the road, fearing what I'd find. Worse than I imagined—the tall stone chimney stood sentinel over the blackened rubble. Only the outline of the house remained, the furniture still sat around the stone table on the patio as if waiting for lunch. Tears blurred my vision.</p>
<p>The metal motorcycle shop, formerly obscured by the house, seemed intact. As I stepped closer, my teary eyes focused on the spray painted tags, "Burn the fags."</p>
<p>I turned away and ran back down the road, jumped on the bike, heading South toward Flathead Lake. I could get to Cherry's place in forty minutes.</p>
<h2 id="FinleyPoint,FlatheadLake">Finley Point, Flathead Lake</h2>
<p>I rode up the Finley Point roads way too fast—desperate for Cherry's house at the orchard—he'd be there with his family. I fishtailed on washboards—nearly overshot a curve. I made the same wrong turn that I had done last year when Vince sent me down here. I finally rolled up to Cherry's manufactured home—all buttoned up, curtains closed, no open windows, garage door closed.</p>
<p>I parked facing outward, having turned the bike around in one move. I jumped off and caught my boot on the seat—fell flat—nearly face into the gravel. I leapt back up. Ran to his door.</p>
<p>I thought I heard a shout from inside.</p>
<p>I knocked—stopped to listen. Nothing. I hammered on it. "Cherry! Are you in there? This is, uh, Two Braids. Please come to the door."</p>
<p>I heard a thump inside and another muffled shouting voice—a woman's voice—terrified.</p>
<p>"Cherry? Are you there? I can't find anybody!"</p>
<p>The window nearest the door opened just a crack. Cherry's voice boomed out. "Step over to your bike. Get away from the door."</p>
<p>I hesitated and then complied, walking backwards one step at a time until I felt the bike behind me. A couple more steps placed the bike between me and Cherry's door. I heard a latch turn, the door open just wide enough for the double barrels of a shotgun.</p>
<p>I raised my hands.</p>
<p>"Cherry, brother. I just want to know what happened. I can't find Vince or Chris. The Horse is gone. Their house is gone."</p>
<p>"I'm not your brother anymore!" Cherry's anger sprayed out like acid. "The Bastards are done."</p>
<p>"What happened?" My voice cracked in my distress.</p>
<p>"Nomads. They burned everything. Now get the fuck off my property—get away from my family!"</p>
<p>"Where's Vince?" I shouted back.</p>
<p>"Vince is dead. Now move! Get the fuck out of here!"</p>
<p>"...dead?" That familiar adrenal flush swept from my chest to my hands.  Everything got bright. Vince, dead? The shaking started at my jaw, expanded rapidly to my arms.</p>
<p>I saw the gun barrel flick upward and fire, the blast ripping through the pine branches over my head. I flinched hard, felt falling debris pelting on my leathers and my head—fell back behind the bike, ears ringing. The blast echoed off the hillside like the thunder from last time I was here. Then my hearing went silent—like diving into the deep end.</p>
<p>As if from a half mile away, I heard Cherry call out. “I got kids in here! Don’t make me fire the other barrel!”</p>
<p>Same panic as that day with David—wild urge to run. I pulled myself up, climbed onto the bike. My ears rang with a white noise roar, like the birds and the wind had just stopped. I started the bike, popped the clutch and tore down the road. I couldn't hear my engine, couldn't tell when to shift.</p>
<p>A quarter mile out, the bike fishtailed, turned into a death wobble—I lost it in the loose gravel. Hit the dirt hard. Leapt up, dragged the bike upright—goddamn the fucker's heavy. Second time I dropped a bike—like that day I learned to ride. Remounted, started it, and pointed at the highway. My eye watered, I could feel the tears running down my right cheek.</p>
<p>I turned North back to Columbia Falls, more tears streaming into the wind. Vince dead? It can't be true.</p>
<h2 id="NotWhereIMeantToGo">Not Where I Meant To Go</h2>
<p>I rode up to Big Fork. If I kept up heading north, I'd be right back in Columbia Falls. Didn't want to go there. Hard right turn onto MT83 south—the reverse direction from that first ride with David and Ted.</p>
<p>Stopped in Seeley Lake for gas. The guy filling up on the other side of the pump—nervous, twitchy—kept sneaking glances at me. I scowled. The cashier went wide eyed as I stepped up—like she was afraid. I kept my head down.</p>
<p>"Pump five." I dropped a twenty on the counter. Took the bills, left the coins.</p>
<p>Tearing down the highway by the ascending chain of glacial lakes, I turned left on MT200 toward Rogers Pass. As a kid, I loved seeing that ridiculous giant cow sculpture at the junction. Looks stupid now.</p>
<p>I wanted the wind and the highway to settle me. Always works. Not  today.</p>
<p>Vince dead? No, that's not right. He's gotta be with Chris and Sarah. They're safe, just don't know where.</p>
<p>I stopped at the top of the pass by the sign announcing the continental divide. I walked into the forest on the north side of the road to piss. A rough trail snaked through the trees up along the ridge line.</p>
<p>Hiking north along the continental divide—hundred thirty miles—I could be at my cabin in two weeks. Disappear into my mountains like I did two years ago.</p>
<p>Just walk away from my bike. No. David's bike.</p>
<p>Don't have my pack, got no food, got no water, no sleeping bag, no tent. Wrong boots—I'd be crippled in a couple hours.</p>
<p>No, not walking into the wilderness.</p>
<p>I turned around, stalked back to the bike, mounted, started it up. Startled at the ignition sound—hearing again. I heard the tap-tap-tap of the lifters in the engine. Like the pushrods of Vince's chopper. Vince was dead.</p>
<p>I sat there frozen, hands on the handlebars, face forward, side stand up, bike leaning its weight on my right leg. Tears streamed down my face as cars, trucks, and a couple Goldwings cruised by.</p>
<p>My shadow stretched to the double yellow by the time my eyes ran out of tears.  I pulled in the clutch, stomped it into first and took off eastbound.  Took the turn onto MT435—carved the curves as if the Nomads were right on my ass. Transfixed, I watched the evening highway flash by me. Two near misses—an antelope, the other—misjudged a curve and crowded the center line as I met a box truck going the other way.</p>
<p>Started seeing my headlights on the roadside sage as I rolled into Augusta. Turned left a block before Ted's gas station, then onto his road, and up into his driveway.</p>
<h2 id="Augusta,Montana">Augusta, Montana</h2>
<p>I turned the bike off, pushed the side stand down, and slowly leaned the bike over as if I feared marring the concrete.</p>
<p>The front door popped open and Ted literally ran out across the lawn and to the driveway.</p>
<p>“Karl! Oh thank God, we’ve been worried sick.” He put his hand on my shoulder, as I turned to look at him. “You’re bleeding. Get off the bike. C’mon inside.” He pressed his hand on my back, prompting me to move.</p>
<p>Maggie stepped up as I dismounted the bike. The roar in my ears surged as I stood up. Her eyes scanned me methodically, assessing my condition. “I’ll get the first aid kit.” She turned around and rushed back to the front door.</p>
<p>Ted escorted me inside as if I were an aged relative. He took me straight to the kitchen sink where Maggie waited with gauze pads and alcohol wipes.</p>
<p>“Let’s see what we've got going on here. I'm gonna pull your bandana off.” She lifted gingerly, but I felt a sudden pull above my right ear. "Ok, we got some adhesion." After several minutes of gentle tugging and rinsing with a warm washcloth, she pulled it free. She tossed it on the counter. I stared at my bandana in amazement—crusted with brown dried blood. How did I get blood on me?</p>
<p>The sting of the gauze pad that she pressed against my temple answered that question.</p>
<p>She walked me to the kitchen table. "Karl, you probably don't know, but Ted and I are both retired officers from the Army. I'm a nurse—95th Evac Hospital—outside Da Nang."</p>
<p>She spouted orders at Ted. "Fetch lights for the table. I need the saline from my contact lens kit. Your blood pressure cuff, too. Vodka will have to do for sterilizing." They never left me alone as they alternated fetching what Maggie needed. It seemed like they had practiced this.</p>
<p>Maggie poured a glass half full with vodka and dropped in a handful of crochet hooks and a couple sizes of tweezers.</p>
<p>She gently probed my mystery injury and then declared, "There's something under the skin here—back in 'Nam we pulled shrapnel outta boys younger than you with a flashlight and a pocketknife. We'll get this out real quick. It'll sting, but you’re gonna be fine."</p>
<p>"You're lucky I'm doing this instead of Ted. He'd probably try to use a socket wrench." She smiled at her own joke, but, I didn't react—thinking about the roar still in my ears.</p>
<p>No idea how much time passed. The lights were too bright. I had to keep my eyes shut—couldn't watch.</p>
<p>I clung to strong memories of my makeshift operation: the clink of the shot glass as Maggie dropped a chunk of metal and the tiny bottle of superglue—of all things—she used instead of stitches.</p>
<p>Ted picked up the shot glass and examined it. "That's buckshot, not some sort of shrapnel." He looked at me. "Karl, you've been shot."</p>
<p>Maggie pointed at my forehead. "You can see the path. Grazed above the eyebrow, skipped over the temple and into the scalp at the hairline. They line up perfectly. An inch lower, you coulda lost your eye, or worse."</p>
<p>Ted mused, "Gotta be a ricochet. Would's gone through his head straight from the barrel." He looked back to me sitting at the table. "Karl, how did this happen?"</p>
<p>Our eyes locked and my question just spilled out. “Cherry is my brother. Why'd he shoot at me?” The first words I spoke since arriving seemed distant, as if somebody else's voice.</p>
<p>“Your brother?” Maggie looked horrified.</p>
<p>Ted shook his head. “He means bike club brother, not real brother." He let out a loud breath. "This is bad."</p>
<p>Ted looked over to his wife, concern etched into his forehead. "I’m gonna push his bike into the garage—don’t think I want that flag flying in front of the house tellin' everyone you're here." He rushed through the laundry room and out the door to the garage. I heard the big door roll up.</p>
<p>Maggie started straightening up the makeshift exam room, shoving some bloody gauze into a plastic bag.</p>
<p>Ted returned from the garage. "Your bike's inside. Safe. I know where the shot ricocheted. There's a dent and paint chipped off the tank." He paused. "That’s David’s bike, isn’t it?"</p>
<p>I just closed my eyes.</p>
<p>He sighed again, accepting my non-answer. He reached to the table and picked up the shot glass. “You’re gonna want t’keep this.” He held up the bloody pellet. “I’ll find you a little box for it.”</p>
<p>Ted started in with questions. The answers, though, burned my throat.</p>
<p>"I showed up for my shift this afternoon—the Horse was burned out. I couldn't find anybody. Vince and Chris's house was burned too. I don't know what happened. Dolph's house was cleared out. I couldn't find any of my club brothers."</p>
<p>"Oh, Karl, you weren't even there.  It was in all the papers, it happened last weekend. They said it was a biker gang war. The Iron Horse was fire bombed with people inside. Six died. They said it was Nomads."</p>
<p>"Cherry said Vince died."</p>
<p>Ted pursed his lips and then confirmed it. "The newspaper said he was a hero. He went back in and carried people out. The last time he went in, the roof collapsed. He didn't get back out."</p>
<p>I squeezed my eyes shut, but it didn't stop the tears.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of my silent tears, Ted returned to questions. "When did you get shot?"</p>
<p>"This afternoon..." I stuttered and stopped speaking—hard to make sentences. "I couldn't find anybody in Columbia Falls or Whitefish... I rode down to Finley Point to find Cherry." The urgency to find someone rose again from my chest. I started to get up. "I gotta find someone."</p>
<p>Ted put his hand on my shoulder. "Just stay down, son. Just stay still for a while. You don't have to find anybody right now.  What happened on Finley Point?"</p>
<p>"Cherry wouldn't talk to me. He yelled at me to get away from his family. He opened the door just enough for the shotgun. It was so loud. I fell over, hit my head on the ground."</p>
<p>Ted looked aghast.</p>
<p>"I rode away. I couldn't hear anything. I rode to Big Fork and then into the Swan Valley."</p>
<p>Ted stared at me, jaw slack. "You rode more'n three hours to get here from Finley Point after he shot at you?"</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to come here. It's just where I ended up. I'm afraid to go home."</p>
<p>Maggie interrupted with an acid glare at Ted. "Enough. Enough with the questions. He's my patient, you're not gonna get him all worked up."</p>
<p>Ted backed down without objection.</p>
<p>She turned to me. "We're gonna get you in bed and give you some pain meds."</p>
<p>They escorted me to their guest bedroom. Got me stripped of my riding leathers and into bed.</p>
<p>Ted held up my jacket, looking at the Bitterroot Bastard patch. "You've got blood on your patch. Suppose that happens to all of ’em eventually."</p>
<p>I lay in the bed, listening to them talk in the bathroom across the hall.</p>
<p>"Got some Percodan left from when I tore up my knee. That’ll take the edge off."</p>
<p>Maggie responded. "No, that's too strong. He’s skinny as a rake and hasn’t eaten. Not gonna risk that. I got Tylenol with codeine, ugh, three years out of date. Well, it's what we got. There's a Valium, too. That'll calm him down to get some sleep."</p>
<p>"I still say the red ones would do the trick." Ted sounded impatient.</p>
<p>"Stand down." She used a voice right out of a war movie. "I'm the nurse here."</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>
<p>I heard the sink tap open as they filled a glass. Moments later, they returned to the room, setting the pills and the water on the bedside table. She checked my pulse and then wrapped the blood pressure cuff around my arm.</p>
<p>As the cuff hissed out its pressure, she looked at me. "You running hot. Pretty stressed. I want you to take these pills."</p>
<p>She handed me the pills, then the water.  "I'm gonna stay here with you until you're asleep."</p>
<p>I think she did.</p>
