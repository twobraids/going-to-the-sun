            <h2 id="GoingtoTheSunRoad">Going to The Sun Road</h2>
<p>Oblene Bend, just downhill from the crest of Logan Pass—blocked by big horn sheep and tourists. Eleven cars ahead and probably twice that many behind—stretched out of sight beyond the curve. The tourists had cameras stuck to their eyes. The sheep had flies on theirs. Every few minutes, several sheep scrambled up the slope, but just as many dropped back onto the pavement. The tourists did the same thing by climbing in and out of their cages.</p>
<p>I shut the bike down and leaned it over. Perfect chance to sit on the rock wall and admire the view. Peering over the edge, I could see fifteen hundred feet nearly straight down into dark forests and gray expanses of talus. Almost the same view as The Ledge, the hiking trail I took the guys on last summer. Twisting around, I craned my neck—two hundred feet up—an impression of the trail, no direct view. I smiled, remembering Vince's laughter as he peered down that drop. I could have waved at him from here. That memory hooked me until the sound of a whining truck engine—first gear—pulled me back.</p>
<p>A park ranger truck, crept slowly down the wrong side of the road. Probably dispatched all the way from St. Mary to untangle this mess.</p>
<p>Took forty minutes to finish the descent to US2. Way behind schedule—gonna be late for my shift—supposed to start at four. I shook my head, a commuter route through a national park—rarely a good idea.</p>
<p>Once out of the park, I could push the speed limit. That twelve-mile West Glacier to Hungry Horse run, pushing the limit meant forty.</p>
<p>Just like always, I flew through Bad Rock Canyon at top speed—getting off on the thrill of the curves.</p>
<p>Still gonna roll up to the Iron Horse a half hour later than I wanted—a four to midnight card dealing shift tonight.</p>
<h2 id="TheIronHorse">The Iron Horse</h2>
<p>I smelled it a full block before I saw it—acrid, wrong. My heart leapt to my throat when I turned that last corner to the Horse. It was gone. Just a hollow rectangle of brick walls, darkened with soot. Daylight through the glassless windows showed blackened wooden beams crisscrossing each other from the collapsed roof. The blackened bones of more than a half dozen motorcycles, some still on their side stands, stood guard along the front.</p>
<p>Wait, that's Vince's chopper by the front door—one of the fish tail pipes flat on the asphalt, the other sagging to the side at the wrong angle—like they melted. He loved that bike—the one with the noisy pushrods—the one he built himself.</p>
<p>Marks on the asphalt showed this hadn’t just happened—no water—all dry. I traced where rivers of fire hose runoff had floated cinders and ash into the street. This happened days ago. No fire fighters around, no cops, nobody to tell me what happened.</p>
<p>I began to tremble.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I needed to call Vince and Chris. The payphone by the door—not viable.  I looked around the lot and down the street—stupid—not as if somebody had just installed a new one. Turned back to the shell of the Horse—the burnt corpse of Vince's chopper—my eyes started watering.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The bike bucked as I slammed it into first gear—late clutch. Aimed back to the highway. A battered notepad on the asphalt caught my eye. I stopped with a short skid. I popped off the bike as if spring-loaded. A tire track over a notepad, the spiral rings crushed flat, the pages fanned out like a deck of cards. I picked it up, bent it to see the pages—pencil sketches of smiling faces—people I knew and loved. I crammed it into the breast pocket of my jacket—wouldn’t fit—pushed hard, felt pages rip. I jumped back onto the bike.</p>
<h2 id="Whitefish">Whitefish</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I tore down the road looking left and right. Spotted a payphone in front of the old Rexall Drug. I jumped the bike up the curb and set the side stand down. I stood in front of the phone for a moment—I've got no fucking coins. Remember—last time with the red box... Shit, East Glacier Trading Post. Fucking left at the cabin.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I jumped back on the bike—I’d just have to go to their house—I rode like a madman to Whitefish, then turned south on US93—pulled off on a side road and followed a maze of turns to their dirt road. I made the turn, but skidded to a stop at bright yellow tape, fluttering feebly in the breeze, blocking their single-lane driveway. "CRIME SCENE - DO NOT CROSS."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Swallowed hard, got off the bike, ducked under the tape and ran up the road, terrified at what I'd find. Worse than I imagined—the tall stone chimney stood sentinel over the blackened rubble. Only the outline of the house remained, the furniture still sat around the stone table on the patio as if waiting for lunch.</p>
<p>Fuck—tears now.</p>
<p>The metal motorcycle shop, formerly obscured by the house, seemed intact. As I stepped closer, my teary eyes focused on the spray-painted tag, "Fags burn."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Everything got really bright—as if a second sun joined the sky. I turned away and ran back down the road, jumped on the bike, headed toward Kalispell. One by one I checked the homes and businesses of my club brothers—all locked down. Did the same tour of Whitefish—nobody around. Then I remembered Cherry and his orchards—hit MT35 South for the east side of Flathead Lake—only forty minutes.</p>
<h2 id="FinleyPoint,FlatheadLake">Finley Point, Flathead Lake</h2>
<p>I rode up the Finley Point roads way too fast—desperate for Cherry's house at the orchard—he'd be there with his family. I fishtailed on washboards—nearly overshot a curve. I made the same wrong turn that I had done last year when Vince sent me down here. I finally rolled up to Cherry's manufactured home—all buttoned up, curtains closed, no open windows, garage door closed.</p>
<p>I parked facing outward, having turned the bike around in one move. I jumped off and caught my boot on the seat—fell flat—nearly face into the gravel. I leapt back up. Ran to his door.</p>
<p>I thought I heard a shout from inside.</p>
<p>I knocked—stopped to listen. Nothing. I hammered on it. "Cherry! Are you in there? This is your brother, Two Braids. Please come to the door."</p>
<p>I heard a thump inside and another muffled shouting voice—a woman's voice—terrified.</p>
<p>"Cherry? Are you there? I can't find anybody!"</p>
<p>The window nearest the door opened just a crack. Cherry's voice boomed out. "Step over to your bike. Get away from the door."</p>
<p>I hesitated and then complied, walking backwards one step at a time until I felt the bike behind me. A couple more steps placed the bike between me and Cherry's door. With a click, a latch turned, the door opened just wide enough for the double barrels of a shotgun.</p>
<p>I raised my hands.</p>
<p>"Cherry, brother. I just want to know what happened. I can't find Vince or Chris. The Horse is gone. Their house is gone."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I'm not your brother anymore!" Cherry's anger—acid—scared. "The Bastards are done."</p>
<p>"What happened?" My voice cracked in my distress.</p>
<p>"Nomads. They burned everything. Now get the fuck off my property—get away from my family!"</p>
<p>"Where's Vince?" I shouted back.</p>
<p>"Vince is dead. Now move! Get the fuck out of here!"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"...dead?" I froze in place. That all-too-familiar adrenal flush exploded in my chest. Everything got bright. Vince, dead? The shaking started at my jaw, expanded rapidly to my arms.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“I got kids in here! Don’t make me fire.” His words came from miles away.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The gun barrel flicked upward and flashed with fire, the blast ripping through the pine branches over my head. I flinched hard, felt falling debris pelting on my leathers and sting above my left temple. I fell to the ground behind the bike, ears ringing. The blast echoed off the hillside like the thunder from last time I was here. Then my hearing went silent—like diving into the deep end.</p>
<p>Same panic as that day with David—wild urge to run. I pulled myself up, climbed onto the bike. My ears rang with a hollow white noise, like the birds and the wind had just stopped. I started the bike, popped the clutch and tore down his driveway. I couldn't hear my engine, could only tell when to shift by feel.</p>
<p>A quarter mile out, the bike fishtailed, turned into a death wobble—I lost it in the loose gravel. I hit the dirt hard. Stunned for just a moment, I scrambled up, dragged the bike upright—goddamn, the fucker's heavy. It was the second time I dropped a bike—like that day I learned to ride. I remounted, started it, and pointed at the highway. My eyes watered, I could feel the tears running hard down my right cheek.</p>
<p>I turned north back toward Columbia Falls, more tears streaming into the wind. Vince dead? It couldn’t be true.</p>
<h2 id="NotWhereIMeantToGo">Not Where I Meant To Go</h2>
<p>I rode up to Big Fork. If I kept up heading north, I'd be right back in Columbia Falls. Didn't want to go there. Hard right turn onto MT83 south—the reverse direction from that first ride with David and Ted—gotta go the long way around to get home.</p>
<p>Stopped in Seeley Lake for gas. The guy filling up on the other side of the pump—nervous, twitchy—kept sneaking glances at me. I scowled. The cashier went wide-eyed as I stepped up—like she was afraid. She said something, I saw her lips move. I couldn't hear her. I kept my head down.</p>
<p>"Pump five." I dropped a twenty on the counter. Took the bills, left the coins.</p>
<p>Back on the highway, I flew down the valley past the descending chain of glacial lakes: Seeley, Placid, Salmon, Elbow, and Harpers. I turned left on MT200—Clearwater Junction—toward Rogers Pass. As a kid, I loved seeing that ridiculous giant cow sculpture at the junction. Looked stupid now.</p>
<p>I wanted the wind and the highway to settle me. Always worked. Not today.</p>
<p>Vince dead? No, that's not right. He's gotta be with Chris and Sarah. They're safe, just don't know where.</p>
<p>I stopped at the top of the pass by the sign announcing the continental divide—5,610 feet. I walked into the forest on the north side of the road to piss. A rough trail snaked through the trees up along the ridge line.</p>
<p>Hiking north along the Continental Divide—hundred thirty miles—I could be at my cabin in two weeks. Disappear into my mountains like I did two years ago.</p>
<p>Just walk away from my bike. No. David's bike.</p>
<p>Don't have my pack, got no food, got no water, no sleeping bag, no tent. Wrong boots—I'd be crippled in a couple hours.</p>
<p>No, not walking into the wilderness.</p>
<p>I turned around, stalked back to the bike, mounted, started it up. Startled at the ignition sound—hearing again. I heard the tap-tap-tap of the lifters in the engine. Like the pushrods of Vince's chopper. Vince was dead.</p>
<p>I sat there frozen, hands on the handlebars, face forward, side stand up, bike leaning its weight on my right leg. Tears streamed down my face as cars, trucks, and a couple Goldwings cruised by.</p>
<p>My shadow stretched to the double yellow by the time my eyes ran out of tears. I pulled in the clutch, stomped it into first, and took off eastbound. Took the turn onto MT435—carved the curves as if the Nomads were right on my ass. Transfixed, I watched the evening highway flash by me. Two near misses—an antelope, the other—misjudged a curve and crowded the center line as I met a box truck going the other way.</p>
<p>My headlight lit up the roadside sage—jackrabbits and gophers —as I rolled into Augusta. Turned left a block before Ted's gas station, then onto his road, and up into his driveway.</p>
<h2 id="Augusta,Montana">Augusta, Montana</h2>
<p>I turned the bike off, pushed the side stand down, and slowly leaned the bike over as if I feared marring the concrete. For a moment, my hands just hung on the handlebars. Looking over the garage to the southern sky, I saw stars—just a few, not quite dark enough for constellations—no solace from my Great Bear.</p>
<p>Ted’s front door banged open. I caught the movement, but not so much the sound. He burst out and ran across the lawn to me. “Karl! Oh, thank God, we’ve been worried sick.”</p>
<p>He sounded so far away. I held my left hand up to my ear to help me hear.</p>
<p>He put his hand on my shoulder as his expression changed from relief to concern. “You’re bleeding. Get off the bike. C’mon inside.” He pressed his hand on my back, prompting me to move.</p>
<p>Maggie stepped up as I dismounted the bike. The roar in my ears surged as I stood up. Her eyes scanned me methodically, assessing my condition. “I’ll get the first aid kit.” She turned around and rushed back to the front door.</p>
<p>Ted escorted me inside as if I were an aged relative. He took me straight to the kitchen sink where Maggie waited with gauze pads and alcohol wipes.</p>
<p>Maggie peered closely at the right side of my face. “Let’s see what we've got going on here. I'm gonna pull your bandana off.” She lifted gingerly, but I felt a sudden pull above my right ear. “OK, we got some adhesion." After several minutes of gentle tugging and rinsing with a warm washcloth, she pulled it free. She tossed it on the counter. I stared at my bandana in amazement—crusted with brown dried blood. How did I get blood on me?</p>
<p>The sting of the gauze pad that she pressed above my temple answered that question.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0069" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She walked me to the kitchen table. "Karl, you probably don't know, I'm a retired officer from the Army. I'm a nurse—95th Evac Hospital—outside Da Nang."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0070" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She sat me down in the chair at the close end of the table. "Karl, you've got a problem that we need to address right now. No delay for a doctor. Don't think you need a dust-off, though."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0071" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>That confused me—that word—heard it before.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0072" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She spouted orders at Ted. "Fetch lights for the table. I need the saline from my contact lens kit, the big bottle. Your blood pressure cuff, too. Vodka will have to do for sterilizing." They never left me alone as they alternated fetching what Maggie needed. It seemed like they had practiced this.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0073" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Once they settled in with all their tools, Maggie started with a flashlight. She shined in my eyes one at a time in quick flicking motion.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0074" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Ok, that's real good, Karl. Dilations fine" She held my hand and asked me to squeeze it. This seemed so silly</p>
<p><b><span id="U0075" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Maggie poured a glass half full with vodka and dropped in a handful of what looked like giant crochet hooks along with a couple sizes of tweezers.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0076" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She gently probed my scalp all over my head. I flinched a couple  times but only near my right temple.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0077" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"There's something under the skin here." She switched to her commanding voice that compelled me to listen. "Back in 'Nam we pulled shrapnel outta boys younger than you with a flashlight and a pocketknife. We'll get this out real quick. It'll sting, but you’re gonna be fine."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0078" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You're lucky I'm doing this instead of Ted. He'd probably try to use pliers." She smiled at her own joke, but I didn't react—thinking about the roar still in my ears.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0079" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>No idea how much time passed. The lights were too bright. I had to keep my eyes shut. One abrupt pulse of pain, a full-body flinch, then she dropped a bloody chunk of metal into the shot glass. She emptied her entire bottle of contact lens saline to rinse the wound.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0080" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Ted picked up the shot glass and examined it. "That's not road gravel. That's from a shotgun." He looked at me with a bunched up forehead and wide eyes. "Karl, you've been shot."</p>
<p>Maggie pointed at my forehead. "You can see the path. Grazed above the eyebrow, skipped over the temple and into the scalp at the hairline. They line up perfectly." She looked straight at me. "An inch lower, you woulda lost your eye, or worse."</p>
<p>Ted mused, "Gotta be a ricochet. Would've gone right through his head straight from the barrel." He looked back to me sitting at the table. "Karl, it’s time to talk. How did this happen?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0083" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Our eyes locked and it just spilled out. “Cherry is my brother. Why'd he shoot at me?” The first words I spoke since arriving seemed distant, as if somebody else's voice. I gasped, my throat seizing as the realization swept over me. I just ratted out a brother—I broke the code.</p>
<p>“Your brother?” Maggie looked horrified.</p>
<p>Ted shook his head. “He means bike club brother, not real brother." He let out a loud breath. "This is real bad."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0086" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Ted looked over to his wife, concern etched into his forehead. "I’m gonna push his bike into the garage—don’t think I want that flag flying in front of the house tellin' anyone he’s here." He rushed through the laundry room and out the door to the garage. I heard the big door roll up.</p>
<p>Maggie started straightening up the makeshift exam room, shoving some bloody gauze into a plastic bag.</p>
<p>Ted returned from the garage. "The bike's inside. Safe. I know how the shot ricocheted. There's a dent and paint chipped off the tank." He paused. "That’s David’s bike, isn’t it?"</p>
<p>I just closed my eyes.</p>
<p>He sighed again, accepting my non-answer. He reached to the table and picked up the shot glass. “You’re gonna want t’keep this.” He held up the bloody pellet. “I’ll find you a little box for it.”</p>
<p>Ted started in with more questions. "Karl, you got the police after you?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0092" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked at him, trying to make sense. "Showed up for my shift this afternoon—the Horse was gone, burned out—Vince, Chris, I couldn't find anybody." Tasted ash.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0093" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Oh, Karl, you weren't there? Nobody told you? It was in all the papers and on television. It happened last weekend. They said it was a biker gang war."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0094" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shook my head, but it hurt to do it. "Cherry said Vince died."</p>
<p>Ted looked over to Maggie and I thought I saw a subtle head shake. "I don't know. The paper said some people died, but it didn't list who."</p>
<p>That head shake told me all I needed to know. I struggled to hold myself in one piece. After a few minutes of my silent tears, Ted resumed the questions. "When did you get shot?"</p>
<p>"This afternoon..." I stuttered and stopped speaking—hard to make sentences. "I couldn't find anybody... I rode down to Finley Point on the lake to find Cherry." The urgency rose again from my chest. I started to get up. "I gotta find them."</p>
<p>Ted put his hand on my shoulder. "Just stay down, son. Just stay still. You don't have to find anybody right now. What happened on Finley Point?"</p>
<p>I just looked at him. He nodded, prompting me to speak. "Cherry yelled to get away from his family. The shotgun was so loud. I fell. Hit my head."</p>
<p>Ted looked so sad.</p>
<p>"I rode away. I couldn't hear anything. I rode to Big Fork and then down the Swan Valley."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0102" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Ted stared at me, jaw slack. "That's three hours away." He raised his hand up to his own forehead and rubbed his brow.</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to come here. It's just where I ended up. I'm afraid to go home."</p>
<p>Maggie interrupted with an acid glare at Ted. "Enough. Enough with the questions. He's my patient, you're not gonna get him all worked up any more than he is now."</p>
<p>Ted backed down.</p>
<p>She turned to me. "We're gonna get you in bed and give you some pain meds."</p>
<p>They escorted me to their guest bedroom. Got me stripped of my riding leathers and into bed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0108" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Ted held up my jacket, his old jacket, looking at the Bitterroot Bastard patch. "You've got blood on your patch. Suppose that happens to all of ’em eventually."</p>
<p>I lay in the bed, listening to them talk in the bathroom across the hall.</p>
<p>"Got some Percodan left from when I tore up my knee. That’ll take the edge off."</p>
<p>Maggie responded. "No, that's too strong. He’s skinny as a rake and hasn’t eaten. Not gonna risk that. I got Tylenol with codeine, ugh, three years out of date. Well, it's what we got. There's a Valium, too. That'll calm him down to get some sleep."</p>
<p>"I still say the red ones would do the trick." Ted sounded impatient.</p>
<p>"Stand down." She used that authority voice right out of a war movie. "I'm the nurse here."</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>
<p>I heard the sink tap open as they filled a glass. Moments later, they returned to the room, setting the pills and the water on the bedside table. She checked my pulse and then wrapped the blood pressure cuff around my arm.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0116" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As the cuff hissed out its pressure, she looked at me. “You’re running hot. Pretty stressed. I want you to take these pills. I think you're exhausted."</p>
<p>She handed me the pills, then the water. "I'm gonna stay here with you until you're asleep."</p>
<p>I have a vague memory or dream of Maggie's voice. "We gonna call the sheriff?"</p>
