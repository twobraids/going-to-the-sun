            <h2 id="GoingtoTheSunRoad">Going to The Sun Road</h2>
<p>Big horn sheep made me late. Right around Oblene bend, blocking both lanes of the road. They wouldn’t move. Traffic backed up in both directions. Ten cars in front of me and at least twenty behind me. Every so often a few sheep would ascend up the mountain and just as many would drop back down onto the road way.  Probably took forty minutes to get the road cleared and that put me way behind schedule.</p>
<p>Once out of the park, I could push the speed limit. Yeah, in that twelve mile Belton to Hungry Horse run, pushing the limit meant forty. I really flew through Back Rock Canyon, still gonna roll up to the Iron Horse a half hour later than I wanted. I had a four to midnight dealing shift that night.</p>
<h2 id="TheIronHorse">The Iron Horse</h2>
<p>My heart leapt to my throat when I turned that last corner to the Horse. It was gone. Just a hollow rectangle of brick walls, darkened with soot. Daylight though the glassless windows displayed blackened wooden beams criss crossing each other from the collapsed roof.</p>
<p>This didn’t just happen. Everything was dry, I could see where rivers of firehose runoff had floated cinders into the street. This happened days ago. No fire fighters around, no cops, nobody to tell me what happened.</p>
<p>I began to tremble.</p>
<p>I needed to call Vince and Chris. I scanned the street for phone booths—nothing—I survey the bones of the Horse and my eyes started to tear up—slammed the bike into first and started back to the road. A battered notepad on the asphalt caught my eye and I stopped abruptly  popping off the bike as if spring loaded. A spiral bound notepad had been run over, the spiral bindings crushed flat, the pages fanned out like a deck of cards. I picked it up, bent it to see the pages—smiling faces drawn in pencil of people I knew and loved—one of Dolph's notepads.  I stuck it in the breast pocket of my jacket and jumped back onto the bike.</p>
<h2 id="Whitefish">Whitefish</h2>
<p>I tore down the road, spotting a phone booth in front of the decrepit old Rexall Drug. I jumped the bike up the curb and set the side stand down on the sidewalk. No goddamn phone book.</p>
<p>I jumped back on the bike—I’d just have to go to their house—I rode like a madman to Whitefish, then turned south on US93 South—pulled off on a side road and the followed a maze of turns to their dirt road. I made the turn, but skidded to a stop as bright yellow tape, fluttering feebly in the breeze, blocked the dirt driveway: "CRIME SCENE - DO NOT CROSS."</p>
<p>I jumped off the bike, ducked under the tape and ran up the road, fearing what I'd find. Worse than I imagined—the tall stone chimney stood sentinel over the blacked rubble. Only the outline of the house remained, the furniture still sat around the stone table on the patio as if waiting for lunch. Tears blurred my vision.</p>
<p>The metal motorcycle shop, formerly obscured by the house, seemed intact. As I stepped closer, my teary eyes focused on the spray painted tags, "Burn the fags."</p>
<p>I turned away and ran back down the road.</p>
<h2 id="FinleyPoint,FlatheadLake">Finley Point, Flathead Lake</h2>
<p>I rode up the Finley Point roads way too fast—needed to get to Cherry's place—I fishtailed on washboards—nearly overshot a curve. I made the same wrong turn that I had done last year when Vince sent me down here. I finally rolled up to Cherry's manufactured home—all buttoned up, curtains closed, no open windows, garage door closed.</p>
<p>I parked quickly, facing the bike outward. I jumped off the bike and caught my boot on the seat—fell flat—almost face into the gravel. I leapt back up and ran to his door. I thought I heard a shout from inside.</p>
<p>I knocked loudly and stopped to listen. Nothing. I hammered on the door again. "Cherry! Are you in there. This is Karl..., uh, Twobraids. Please come to the door."</p>
<p>I heard a thump inside and muffled voice from inside. "Step back over to your bike."</p>
<p>"Cherry? Is that you? I can't find anybody!"</p>
<p>The window nearest the door opened just a crack and Cherry shouted out to me. "Step over to your bike. Get away from the door."</p>
<p>I hesitated and then complied by walking backwards to the bike. I heard a latch turn, the door open just wide enough for the double barrels of a shotgun. I raised my hands.</p>
<p>"Cherry, brother, I just want to know what happened. I can't find Vince or Chris. The Horse is gone, their house is gone."</p>
<p>"I'm not your brother anymore!" I'd never heard such anger in his voice. "The Bastards are done."</p>
<p>"What happened?" My voice cracked with my distress.</p>
<p>"Nomads. They burned everything. Now get the fuck of my property—get away from my family!"</p>
<p>"Where's Vince?" I shouted back.</p>
<p>"Vince is dead. Now move! Get the fuck out of here!"</p>
<p>"...dead?" Like blanket dropped over me, muffled all the sounds. Vince was dead? I started to shake with the realization.</p>
<p>Then the shotgun fired—not at me, but apparently over my head, the blast ripping through the pine branches above. I flinched hard, felt falling debris pelting on my leathers, fell backwards against the bike, ears ringing. The blast echoed off the hillside like the thunder from last time I was here. Then my hearing went silent—like underwater.</p>
<p>As if from a great distance, I heard Cherry call out. “I got kids in here! Don’t make me fire the other barrel!”</p>
<p>Same panic as that day with David. Same wild urge to run. I pulled myself up and onto the bike. My ears rang with a white noise roar, I couldn't hear the birds or the wind. I started the bike, popped the clutch and fled. I tore down the road to escape. I couldn't hear my engine, couldn't hear when to shift.</p>
<p>A quarter mile out, I dumped the bike on a curve in the loose gravel. Hit the dirt hard. Leapt up, dragged the bike upright—goddamn the fucker's heavy. Second time I dropped a bike—like that first day I learned to ride. I got back on, started it, and headed to the highway.</p>
<p>I turned North back to Columbia Falls, tears streaming into the wind. Vince dead?</p>
<h2 id="NotWhereIMeantToGo">Not Where I Meant To Go</h2>
<p>I rode north until Big Fork. If I kept up north, I'd be right back in Columbia Falls. Didn't want to go there. I turned right onto MT83 south—the reverse direction that first rode it with David and Ted.</p>
<p>I stopped in Sealy Lake for gas, then continued south. I turned left on MT200 toward Rogers Pass. The solace of the wind and the highway seeped into my bones. Vince dead? What about Chris, Dolph and all the others?</p>
<p>I stopped at the top of the pass. I walked into the forest on the north side of the road to piss.  Hiking south along the continental divide—hundred thirty miles—I could be home in two weeks? Just walk away from my bike—David's bike.</p>
<p>Don't have my pack, got no food or water, no sleeping bag, no tent. Wrong boots, I'd be crippled in a couple hours. No, not walking into the wilderness.</p>
<p>I turned around walked back out to the bike, mounted, started it up. I could hear again. I heard the tap-tap-tap of the lifters in the engine. Like the pushrods of Vince's chopper.</p>
<p>I burst into tears. I sobbed and sobbed as cars, trucks, and a couple Goldwings cruised by.</p>
<p>When my eyes dried, I pulled the clutch, stomped it into first and took off eastbound.  I turned onto MT435. I carved the curves as if the Nomads were right on my ass. Two near misses—an antelope, the other—misjudged a curve and crowded the double yellow as I met a box truck going the other way.</p>
<p>In a daze, I rolled into Augusta, turned a block before Ted's garage, then onto his road, and up into his driveway.</p>
<h2 id="Augusta,Montana">Augusta, Montana</h2>
<p>I turned the bike off, pushed the side stand down, and slowly leaned the bike over as if I feared marring the concrete.</p>
<p>The front door popped open and Ted literally ran out across the lawn and to the driveway.</p>
<p>“Karl! Oh thank God, I’ve been worried about you for days.” He put his hand on my shoulder, as I turned my face to look at him. “You’re bleeding. Get off the bike. C’mon inside.” He pressed his hand on my back, prompting me to move.</p>
<p>Maggie stepped up. I heard her gasp when saw my face. “I’ll get the first aid kit.” She turned around and rushed back to the front door.</p>
<p>Ted escorted me inside as if I were an aged relative. He took straight into the kitchen where Maggie waited with gauze pads and alcohol wipes.</p>
<p>She reached up to my forehead. “Let’s get your bandana off.” She lifted it gingerly and set it on the countertop. I saw the front of it was brown with dried blood. My mouth dropped open in amazement. I didn’t even know I had an injury.</p>
<p>“You've been hit with buckshot! You've got a pellet in your hairline! Jesus Christ." Ted looked over to Maggie. "Should we take to the emergency room in Great Falls?" The shake in his voice betrayed the fear behind his composure.</p>
<p>"Nah. This is superficial. I can do this. Just need some tweezers and may something to pull it open a bit more." Maggie turned and rushed out of the room.</p>
<p>Ted put his hand on my shoulder. "Ok, no emergency room for you. I suppose they'd call the cops for a weapon injury. Expect you don't want that right now."</p>
<p>After a few moments later, Maggie returned with a handful of crochet hooks, a couple sizes of tweezers and a bottle of vodka. She poured the vodka in a glass then dropped in her makeshift surgical tools.</p>
<p>“Cherry is my brother, why did he shoot at me?” The first words I spoke with Ted and Maggie seemed distant, as if it were somebody else's voice.</p>
<p>“Your brother?” Maggie looked horrified.</p>
<p>“He means bike club brother, not real brother.” Ted looked at me, the concern wrinkling his forehead. "Karl I don't know why your club brother shot at you. You're gonna have to tell us what happened. Not now, let's get this pellet out of your scalp. We need better lights. Maggie, get him at the table. I'm gonna fetch a couple shop lights."</p>
<p>Maggie sat me down at the kitchen table. We waited for Ted to return. "Karl, you probably don't know, but Ted and I both retired from the Army. I was a nurse the 95th Evac Hospital back in ‘Nam—outside Da Nang—we pulled shrapnel outta boys younger than you with a flashlight and a pocketknife. We'll get this pellet out real quick. It'll sting, but you'll be fine."</p>
<p>"You're lucky I'm doing this instead of Ted. He'd probably try to use a socket wrench." She smiled at her own joke, but, I didn't react.</p>
<p>I don't know how much time passed. The lights were too bright, I had to keep my eyes shut, but ended up with two strong memories of my makeshift operation: the klink in the shot glass as Maggie dropped the pellet in and the tiny bottle of superglue she used to hold the wound together.</p>
<p>They got me settled into a recliner in their living room and then both sat facing me. Ted started the questions, and I haltingly gave answers.</p>
<p>"I showed up for my dealing shift this afternoon and the Horse was burned out. I couldn't find anybody. Vince and Chris's house was burned too. I don't know what happened. Dolph's house was cleared out. I couldn't find any of my club brothers."</p>
<p>"Oh, Karl. It was in all the papers, it happened last weekend. They said it was a biker gang war. The Iron Horse was fire bombed with people inside. Six people were killed. They said it was Nomads."</p>
<p>"Cherry said Vince died."</p>
<p>Ted pursed his lips and then confirmed it. "The newspaper said he was the hero. He went back in and carried people out. The last time he went in, the roof collapsed. He didn't get back out."</p>
<p>I squeezed my eyes shut, but it didn't stop the tears. "Did they say who else died?"</p>
<p>Maggie spoke up. I think Wednesday's paper had the whole list. I'll see if I can find it. She walked out of the room.</p>
<p>"When did you get shot?"</p>
<p>"Sometime this afternoon. I remembered that Cherry lived on Finley Point, I needed to find somebody that knew what happened. I rode from Whitefish and he wouldn't talk to me. He yelled at me to get away from his family and then he fired."</p>
<p>Ted's mouth gaped. "You rode more'n three hours to get here from Finley Point after somebody fired a shotgun at you?"</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to come here. It's just where I ended up. I'm afraid to go home."</p>
<p>Maggie came back in. "I got it. You sure you want to know right now?"</p>
<p>I nodded bracing myself for the worst news.</p>
<p>"Dennis McCall, Tommy Ortega, Lonna Haagland,..."</p>
<p>My yelp interrupted her. I bent over and put my face in my hands and sobbed. Took forever to pull back my composure. I looked up at Maggie. "I covered her shift on Thursday. She took mine on that Saturday. She wasn't even supposed to be there."</p>
<p>Maggie shook her head. "We can finish this some other time, you've had enough."</p>
<p>"No. Keep reading." My voice had more resolve than I did, I wanted her to stop. "I need to know."</p>
<p>"Leon Blodgett, Sheila Johnson, ..."</p>
<p>"Oh, Christ!" I pursed my lips and shook my head. I turned to Ted. "You met her. She was at the table that first night at the poker table."</p>
<p>Ted looked stricken. "I remember her."</p>
<p>"That's the last one, you already know about Vince."</p>
<p>Chris, Sarah, and Dolph survived. How can I find them?</p>
