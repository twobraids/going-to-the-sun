            <h2 id="EastGlacier,Montana">East Glacier, Montana</h2>
<p>I stepped out of the cabin dressed and excited for an autumn ride with David. The yellowing needles of the tamarack hadn't yet started to fall. My eyes caught an odd shadow under the Sportster as I walked up. Not shadow—oil. I got down on my hands and knees, touched the oil to verify it, and then traced out its source. Chewed up like some sort of licorice snack, the black rubber tube, the supply line, dripped the telltale black of SAE 50. I reached up, flexed the tube, and it tore free of the tank, the last gobbets of oil dripping languidly down the side of the engine. Fucking rodents sabotaged my ride. Hopefully, it got a snootful of oil when it broke through. No need to check the tank; it was empty. Any hope for riding the Sportster with David today soaked into the gravel with the oil.</p>
<p>I stripped off my Bastards overlay and carried it back into the house. Walking away from it felt like betrayal, but unlike last week, I will respect Vince’s rule.  I will only wear the patch on a bike owned by the club.</p>
<p>Today was a Honda day. I dreaded David's reaction.</p>
<p>I pushed it out of the shed, brushed the dust off it.  A spider had constructed a web between the left mirror and the handlebar. Once cleaned, I wondered if it was even going to start, though it had only been down for a couple months. I turned it on, kicked it to neutral, and pressed the starter button. It woke up effortlessly. Sounding completely normal, I let it run for a couple of minutes to warm up and then switched it off. I checked the oil level and tire pressure, but found no trouble. This Honda never seemed to break down. They didn't lie in their ads about reliability.</p>
<p>I mounted the Honda, maneuvered down my dirt road to the highway, and took off toward the East Glacier Amtrak station. Ten minutes later, I pulled onto the gravel to wait. Turns out, David was only three or four minutes behind me.</p>
<p>He pulled up with fury on his face. "What the fuck are you doin' on that thing? Where's your Sportster?"</p>
<p>"Mice chewed through the oil supply hose, drained the oil tank. I need a new hose and replacement oil. I'm gonna call Vince later. He's bound to have what I need. I'll head over to Columbia Falls tomorrow. Unless you wanna ride there today? I'll introduce you to Vince—"</p>
<p>“Goddamn it, it’s always somethin’ with you, fuckin’ up my plans.” His anger really annoyed me today. It's not as if I could do anything about this. He just glared at me. “I‘m not ridin’ to Columbia Falls. Today’s ride is gonna be short—I got shit to deal with at the cabin.”</p>
<p>"What's up?" I asked.</p>
<p>“You’re gonna help with a job down at my cabin.” Even at several paces distant, I could smell his whiskey.</p>
<p>Frowning, I mounted my bike and waited for him to lead on. He got on his bike and then fumbled with his jacket, out of my direct line of sight, suddenly shouting out, "God damn it!"  He struggled and eventually freed his flask from the inner pocket and took a long draw.</p>
<p>He started the bike and took off a bit too fast for the gravel lot, slid sideways for a second, and recovered. I'd never seen him mishandle the bike like that. Hitting the asphalt, he turned sharply right, accelerating rapidly, he disappeared through the tunnel-like underpass below the BN railroad tracks.</p>
<p>I followed quickly, not wanting to be too far behind him. Emerging from the underpass, the view of the Glacier National Park Lodge unfolded with its magnificent grounds and promenade between the old Great Northern Railroad station and the hotel's grand entrance.  David, nowhere in sight, apparently treated the 25 mph road as if he were already on the highway. I didn't even try to catch up until well outside  town.  A couple of miles passed when I saw him in the distance ascending the switchbacks just after the Two Medicine Lake cutoff.</p>
<p>The five-mile section of Montana 49 before the junction with US89 climbs over Looking Glass Hill. This highway suffers inadequate money for asphalt maintenance and no budget at all for guard rails. Closed for eight months of the year, it's always in bad shape, dangerous, and a magnet for motorcyclists.</p>
<p>David flew up the hill, a couple of switchbacks ahead of me. Rolling the throttle and down shifting for the grade, I confidently accelerated to catch up. He may have the more powerful highway bike, but the Honda could easily eat the distance between us because it’s so much more nimble in the curves.</p>
<p>When I finally pulled in behind him, his riding appalled me. Yeah, he always seems to take unnecessary risks, but he did so with skill. Today, he rode with a death wish. He rode the centerline even with oncoming traffic, he crossed the centerline on blind turns, he cut inside curves even dropping into the gravel a couple of times at the edge of the asphalt.</p>
<p>He blew through the intersection with US89, ignoring the stop sign and not looking for cross traffic. He did not slow down for the speed restriction zone in St. Mary. He used the left turn lane as a passing lane. Again, he outpaced me and I lost sight of him. Having to catch up to him again, I just spotted him as he unexpectedly turned right onto MT464, skipping his usual stop at the Many Glacier Tavern. Wondering if he was trying to ditch me, I pushed to catch up yet again.</p>
<p>Pacing him after we rejoined US2 Eastbound to Cut Bank proved impossible. He tore down the roadway over any speed where the Honda felt stable. I dropped down to a more prudent sixty-eight. The highway between Browning and Cut Bank is pretty straight and uninteresting. I planned to ride by our usual stop at the cafe in Cut Bank to see if he was there, so I abandoned trying to keep up. If he wasn't there, I wasn't going to chase him anymore; I'd just turn around and ride home.</p>
<p>I pulled into the cafe parking lot as I spotted David next to his bike looking like a thunderstorm. He yelled and flipped off a car leaving the parking lot that had apparently offended him.</p>
<p>Hearing my approach, he turned and shouted at me, "Where the fuck have you been?"</p>
<p>"Hey, you know my, uh, rice burner can't go that fast on the highway, it started to shake over 70, so I rolled the throttle down."</p>
<p>"Piece of shit Jap bike." He placed a sharp kick to my bike’s front tire. The wheel swung to the left, twisting the handlebars out of my hands. I had not yet put the kickstand down, so I nearly dropped the bike. David had already turned and walked away, failing to witness my predicament. Recovering awkwardly, I parked properly and followed him into the café.</p>
<p>We ate our meal at the bar in stony silence. I had no idea what was wrong with him today; it had to be more than me on the Honda. He volunteered nothing. When we finished the meal, I announced that I was going to ride home instead of heading down to his place, implying there would be no ritual blow job today.</p>
<p>"No. You’re comin’ to the cabin. I need a hand with some things."</p>
<p>"With what?" I asked, matching his irritation.</p>
<p>“Ain’t talkin’ about it here.” David shot me a look like I was the idiot. “Just get your ass down to Heart Butte, I’ll lay it out, we’ll knock it out, and you can fuck off back up Marias Pass. Simple.”</p>
<p>"Will you stop being such an ass? You're really over the top today."</p>
<p>A wave of anger swept across his face, his intense eyes caught mine, and we glared at each other.  I'm not the same guy that he met at the grocery store in Browning four months ago. Vince and Chris taught me about standing ground. I bluffed him two months ago at the card table; I can bluff him now. We held our mutual glare way beyond the awkward point. We never really got the chance to see who would look away first. The waitress came to the table and asked if there would be anything more and, if not, presented our split bill. David looked to her, answering her question. I have skill in not looking away from the table where the game is played, but I didn't really think of it as a win.</p>
<p>Just after he dismissed the waitress, I witnessed his face crash. Suddenly I saw him as depressed and vulnerable, not in a way I had ever seen him. Unexpectedly feeling unearned compassion for this tortured man, I agreed to ride on with him. He did not thank me.</p>
<p>Forty minutes later, he pulled over on the highway shoulder unexpectedly. I pulled in behind him as he dismounted, walking back to talk to me. “About a quarter mile up is Mollies Nipple Road. You ride ahead—go have your fun, I’ll fucking catch up.” He didn't wait for my assent, he just turned and walked back to his bike, mounted, pulled out his flask and waiting for me to take lead.</p>
<p>We had never ridden this road together. He had offered it on our first ride together, but then didn't lead me there. I never knew if it had been his indictment of me or just an oversight. This time, however, I took it as a peace offering. I didn't let him know that I had ridden Mollies Nipple a dozen times on my own since he cued me in to its existence.</p>
<p>I took the lead and made, perhaps, my fastest run ever on that seventeen miles where the gravel road hugs Birch Creek. The creek flows from Swift Reservoir, hanging in a cleft of Sawtooth mountains on the west edge of the rez. It winds through the subglacial moraines of the deceased Laurentide Ice Sheet from the last ice age. That means Birch Creek is, geologically speaking, a young creek. Any older mountain drainages lay buried by the till or even simply scraped away. It eventually joins the Marias River, and then the Missouri River, a hundred miles distant.</p>
<p>This Honda really did handle better than the Harley Sportster. Mollies Nipple Road's got the best curves I've found in the plains part of my riding territory. It would be even more fun if it were paved, but as I told David back in May, I'll take it like I get it.</p>
<p>I passed the lead back to David when we reached the pavement of US89. It’s only fair. The guy that rides the fastest in a section ought to ride in the front. I liked this idea of equity in riding with David. I wondered if I can get that in other parts of our friendship.</p>
<p>Another thirty minutes later, David, twenty seconds ahead of me, we arrived at his cabin. I was jacked after that fast ride. The bed of David’s truck crowded the front door. A single rail bike trailer waited off to the side for the Harley.</p>
<p>I jumped off my bike. "What's going on here?"</p>
<p>“Told ya, I don’t stay here in the winter.” David, standing by his bike, shook his head like it should’ve been obvious. “Movin’ all my shit back to Great Falls.”</p>
<p>"You said you weren't leaving until October. Don't you have an elk hunting trip with Ted and those ranch hands in a couple weeks?"</p>
<p>“Ain’t happenin’.” David’s tone seemed final, edged with frustration. “Extraction came early.”</p>
<p>"Why?" I wondered about the odd phrase. Extraction?</p>
<p>"It's just how it is. Somethin' came up—I gotta clear out early this year."</p>
<p>"You need loading help?" Curious about his evasion.</p>
<p>"Yeah, mostly getting the topper onto the truck. Takes two to do it."</p>
<p>Putting the topper onto the bed of the pickup tried the patience of both of us. Securing bolts on one side prevented the other side’s bolts from dropping into position at all. It took precise teamwork to get them to drop at the same moment. David had no teamwork in him today.</p>
<p>We walked into the cabin. The place had exploded into a chaos of furniture, boxes, and trash. We spent the next couple of hours packing and stacking.</p>
<p>This didn't look like move-out for the winter: this looked like abandonment. David carried another box out, and I watched him climb onto the truck bed.</p>
<p>Looking around for other tasks I could do, I noticed a pile of letters on the table. I scanned over them, noting return addresses from law firms and a collection agency. Being nosy and looking at the contents, I saw each letter contained a hammer blow: "foreclosure," "overdue," and the most dire of all from the county sheriff’s office, "seizure."</p>
<p>My heart fell as I realized that the comeuppance came for David's lunatic Sovereign Citizen life. He's losing his cabin refuge. He loved this place; hell, I loved this place, too. No wonder he's been such a shit today. For the second time, compassion bloomed within me, but I found no way to express it without making him mad. It crossed my mind that a warning sign lurked in my fear of his anger, but I dismissed it.</p>
<p>When we completed the bulk of the work, David declared it was enough for the day and he would finish it the morning before he left. He brought out a bottle of whiskey from the cabin, drinking from it directly.</p>
<p>"I know better’n t’offer you any.” He waved his had vaguely at me. “Go ahead…smoke yer junk if ya got it." Had had never heard him drunk.</p>
<p>We sat opposite each other on the picnic table in the lengthening shadows of the late afternoon. Uncharacteristically, the booze melted his usually stoic, composed expression. Equally uncharacteristically, I did not bring out my pipe to smoke. He didn't notice.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I sensed he struggled to come to a decision. "Will you blow me now?"</p>
<p>The question startled me as it came as a first: he had never asked for it. He always had just stated what was to happen. "David, I'm always willing to blow you, any time you want. You’re having a tough day, you can have this one for free.” I tried to be funny. He just sat there looking at me with sad eyes. “Right here, or do you want to go in?"</p>
<p>David squared his shoulders as if he had just come to a major and profound decision. He stood up from the table. “Right here, outside, right now—bare-assed. I can do what the fuck I want in my own goddamn yard!”</p>
<p>He jabbed a finger at nothing in particular, swaying but planting his feet like he was making a stand against the whole world. “I'm a fuckin' free man. Ain’t nobody got the right to tell me otherwise! Nobody!”</p>
<p>He pulled off his T-shirt, revealing his bare skin to me for the first time.  The left half of his body and torso looked completely normal, with dark body hair in the classic hourglass shape—wide across the chest, shrinking to a line, and then wide again at his torso.</p>
<p>The right side, however, was a mass of scars, from mid-ribcage to hip. A few islands of normal, hairy flesh anchored in a turbulent sea of flayed skin and what appeared to be skin grafts. He had no right nipple. Seeing my wide-eyed gaze, he shouted with anger, “This is what Vietnam did to me! This is what a fuckin’ land mine does! One of ours—US-made, US Army-deployed, right under our goddamn feet! I got a dustoff—Derick got a fuckin’ body bag!"</p>
<p>Derick, that name again. I had heard him say the name several times, but never with an explanation. Body bag meant dead. What was a dust off?</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>David’s voice dropped, the fire sputtering out, leaving only the wreckage behind. His words came slower now, thick with sadness heavier than his whiskey. “This… this is why they sent me home. Medical discharge.” He let out a hollow laugh, shaking his head. “They scraped up what was left of me… stuffed all my guts back in, stitched me closed… then decided I was too emotionally unstable for duty.”</p>
<p>Bending over to remove his boots, the alcohol undermined his footing, and he fell backwards onto his ass. I jumped up, helping him pull his boots off. He stood back up unsteadily, then pushed his pants down, revealing another constellation of shrapnel scars down his right leg.</p>
<p>David swayed, his voice thick and unfiltered, the booze stripping away his mask. “You know… Derick used to blow me. Just like you do now.”</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He let out a slow, bitter chuckle, shaking his head. “Hell, he was just as good at it as you are.” His bloodshot eyes locked onto mine, unfocused, heavy. “Every fuckin’ time you’re blowin’ me… I see him.”</p>
<p>His breath shook, and for a second, he wasn’t here anymore—like he was back in a jungle, back in the past, chasing something that died before he ever got the chance to figure it out. Having seen little other than anger and disdain from his emotional spectrum, the tears pouring down his cheeks stunned me. Derick was a dead lover, killed by a land mine.  Empathy surged in my chest for the third time.</p>
<p>Lurching back to the table, he grabbed his whiskey bottle and guzzled.</p>
<p>Horrified, I just stood there, not knowing what to do.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“C’mon… take your clothes off.” He swayed slightly, grinning like he was being clever. “I wanna do it naked. I just wanna hold you.”</p>
<p>He chuckled, the sound low and rough. “Bet you like seein’ me naked… Derick did.”</p>
<p>With growing trepidation, I answered, “Yes, I do. I think you are magnificent.”</p>
<p>I really wanted full on body to body sex with David, but like not with him drunk like this. Maybe this is the only chance I'll ever get? My own lust overwhelmed my judgement and I began to remove my clothes.</p>
<p>Again, David lifted the whisky bottle to his lips. How long until he passes out? He set the bottle down on the picnic table.</p>
<p>Once naked, my own dick pointing rigidly to the sky, I gazed at this beautiful, tragic man, his hairiness, the muscles, even the scars. It suddenly dawned on me that somehow, I loved him. So brave, so tortured, a wounded soldier.</p>
<p>Bracing on the table for a moment, David stepped over to me, grabbing me by the shoulders, drawing me into a tight, full-body embrace. His hard dick poked me abruptly in the stomach, but he shifted and pressed it vertically between our bodies. He held me almost painfully tight. My upper back popped.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>David’s voice softened, the usual roughness fading to distant, almost fragile tones. “Holy fuck… you feel like him.” His fingers lingered, he drew a deep breath. “You even smell like him.”</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He let out a slow, uneven exhale, leaning back to see my face, his eyes glassy, lost in remembering. “That first day… saw you standin’ outside Teeple’s… swear to God, I saw Derick.” His breath hitched, and a sad, slurred chuckle slipped out. “You act like him… talk like him…” He blinked hard, like he was trying to focus but couldn’t. “Hell… you both got fuckin’ skull tattoos…” His voice trailed off, lost somewhere deep in the past.</p>
<p>David swallowed hard, his gaze distant, his voice barely above a whisper. “He always pushed me... always called me on bullshit.. like you do.” He let out a breathy, bitter laugh. “He cleaned me out at poker, too.”</p>
<p>He lowered his voice to nearly inaudible. “He saved my life. I owe him. Too late... I’m too fuckin' late… you’re gone."</p>
<p>His chest rose and fell, his breaths turning ragged and began to tremble. Like a clap of thunder, he raised his voice, “Fourteen fucking years later, and you’re standin’ here, a goddamn ghost, lookin’ at me with his eyes. Why the fuck did you do this to me?!” His face twisted, rage crashing though the grief. “Why’d you leave me behind?! You fuckin’ bastard!”</p>
<p>I didn't have a chance. He pushed me out to arm’s length, drew back his right arm, and drove his fist into the left side of my face. I fell. He hit me again and again while raging in tears. For the first time in my life, I knew what “seeing stars” really meant, and the world abruptly stopped in darkness.</p>
<p>I don't think I was out for long, but I woke lying on my stomach with David on top of me, trying ineptly to push his dick up my ass. I clenched my sphincter and tried to twist out from under him. Too heavy. "David, stop this! Stop now!" My head pounded. My nose dripped blood on the ground. No, no, no, this was not supposed to happen.</p>
<p>"S'okay, Derick, you lie still." He started stroking my hair and pressing his face around the side of my head as if to kiss me.</p>
<p>The smell of his whiskey gave me an idea. "David. David, give me some of your whiskey. I need a drink. David give me some of your whiskey. Where’s your whiskey? What did you do with your whiskey?”</p>
<p>He stopped his probing and muttered, "Where's my whiskey?" He lifted his body off me.</p>
<p>I grabbed my chance. I flipped over onto my back and with as much speed and power as I could summon, I drew my right knee up into his balls. I’m not sure, I think I pleaded, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry."</p>
<p>With a deep shout of pain, he fell back down, crushing the wind out of me. I struggled for air, panic, terror, regret, and anger all shouting in my mind simultaneously.</p>
<p>In his agony, David rolled off of me and drew his legs up into a fetal position. He began to vomit.</p>
<p>I crawled away, still struggling to inhale. Escape must be now. My head spinning, my breath returning only in tiny gasps, I headed toward my pile of clothes. I pulled them on, fumbling sleeves, buttons, and zippers in panic. I grabbed a boot, pulled it on with no sock, stopped, wrong one. Switched feet, I got the boot on, and then the other.</p>
<p>I stood up unsteadily, the world spun, but I planted my feet, fighting the sensation. I felt some relief in discovering the key in my pocket.</p>
<p>David still retched on the ground.</p>
<p>Steeling myself, I tried to walk to my bike, but dizziness took me right back down to my knees. I crawled instead, then used the bike itself as support to get upright and onto the seat.</p>
<p>Muscle memory took me through the steps: I inserted the key, rotated it, turned the fuel petcock on, kicked the transmission up into neutral, hit the run switch with my thumb, and finally pressed the ignition. It started. I rev’d the engine, not going to spend the time to warm it up, put the choke back in, pulled the clutch, stomped it down to first, simultaneously releasing the clutch while rolling the throttle. Spraying gravel behind me, the bike swung wildly to the left, pivoting on its kickstand. I stopped abruptly, coming dangerously close to dropping it. I kicked the stand up, returned my foot to its peg, and tore off down the gravel road. I did not look back. The gravel road warped and turned with my vertigo. It took all my willpower to counter the twisting lies that my eyes showed me.</p>
<p>Leaving David’s road behind me, I flew onto the highway, concentrating on my own survival one second at a time, accelerating, the rhythm of the alternating hand action, left clutch in, right throttle down, foot kick up, left clutch out, right roll throttle, shifting rapidly repeating for each gear: second, third, fourth, fifth. My limbs, all working together seemingly without my help to save my life. It wasn’t until several miles down the highway that I realized tears streamed from my eyes and flew off into the wind—into the wind—into the fucking wind. Riding is always into the wind.</p>
<p>Forty minutes later, I pulled up at my own cabin. I unnecessarily ran in, flipped the light switch—no lights. Jesus, gotta start the generator. I fumbled back out the door and around the side of the A-frame. Just enough light left in the sky to see. Took three pulls of the starter to get it running.  Back inside, this time with lights, my first task was a meal. I ate beans directly from the can.</p>
<p>Terrified that David would pursue me, I knew there wasn't enough gas in the bike to get away. Where would I be safe? Bison Lakes, only a two hour hike. Nobody would know I was there. Flee into the forest, that's my best option. He knows where I live. I can't stay here.</p>
<p>Stepping into the back bedroom with its closet full of my equipment, I started outfitting myself. I yanked my backcountry pack off its peg on the wall and flung it to the bed. It wasn't ready. I had pulled everything out for the change in season. I didn't finish the job, now I pay the price.</p>
<p>I sorted through warm clothes, tossing my selections onto the bed. I picked through it, accepting and rejecting with unaccustomed decisiveness. I changed my clothes, tossed the leather jacket that Ted had given me onto the floor. I donned my wool shirt and pants, my heavy Pivetta boots, ready to become a different person in the forest.</p>
<p>Everything complete, I hefted the pack onto my back, clipped its buckles, and headed for the front door. Catching a glimpse of my face in the mirror near the door, I stopped dead.</p>
<p>I saw a stranger: my beard and mustache clotted with my own dried blood, my left eye swelling and closing, skin turning yellow with growing bruises.</p>
<p>I needed to go. Looking away, swinging the door open and stepping into the night. Not the right sound. Can't expect to hear anything with the generator running.</p>
<p>I stepped off the deck, rounded the side of the cabin, flipped the kill switch. The motor cut out, the reflected light from the windows vanished two seconds later. The sudden loss of noise, the smothering hollow it left behind, and the darkness closed in around me. I held my breath.</p>
<p>Was that a motorcycle on the highway?</p>
<p>No, too constant. Too high-pitched to be a train climbing the pass on the other side of the valley. The roaring noise—not an external sound—my own blood, my nerves, my brain, just the echo of the assault on my body.</p>
<p>The sounds of the night forest leaked into my head, quiet but not silent, a forest full of life: crickets, scurrying hose-chewing rodents, raccoons, a great horned owl, the creek through the forest, browsing deer and elk. Safe, comfortable sounds. They wrapped like a blanket around a frightened child. I sat abruptly down—that uncomfortable back stress of an out-of-balance pack yanking on my shoulders. I began to cry again. The silent tears quickly grew into wracking sobs.</p>
<p>When the sobs faded, a new, inward-pointing anger replaced them. How could I have walked into that? Everything about David should have warned me. I chided myself for having discounted Ted’s warning that first night in the Iron Horse. I chose to ignore the warnings; this was my own fault.</p>
<p>I'm not thinking right—flailing, floundering. I need to calm the fuck down. Then I saw it. My Subaru sat next to the shed, covered in pine needles, asleep. That weird cyclops headlamp in the middle of the grill, stuck open, glared at me. Jesus, I could just drive away any time I wanted. I could get to the Iron Horse in just a couple of hours. Vince and Chris would be there. They don't close for three or four more hours.</p>
<p>Then, laughter—insane laughter. So caught up in my dreams, motorcycles, hiking—I missed the obvious.</p>
<p>Clearing the tears from my undamaged eye, I looked to the sky. The Great Bear hung there, returning the gaze. I traced his lines through the stars, my old friend. I concentrated on breathing, slowly in, hold, slowly out, hold, repeat. After only a few minutes, a kernel of calm appeared within me. My hysterics cleared. I unclipped the pack, I stood up, restarted the generator. I picked up the pack, returned inside. I dumped the pack on the floor near the door.</p>
<p>David had surely passed out long ago and wouldn’t wake for hours. He couldn't come after me tonight. He wasn't even capable of wanting to do so. When he wakes, he won't even remember what happened. I clung to those thoughts as a ladder to safety.</p>
<p>With a kettle on the stove to heat water for washing, I searched for and eventually found a clean washcloth. The first aid kit came from my backpack. For twenty minutes, I stood in front of my mirror, cleaning and attending to my wounded face.</p>
<p>I climbed into the loft and lay down on the bed. I gazed up at my USGS topographic map collage, pinned all the way to the apex of the leaning A-frame walls. My mountains gave me no solace.</p>
<p>The biggest problem lay before me: the secret that I could not keep to myself.  David beat the woman at the motel in July. He just did the same thing to me. I really am just another one of his prostitutes.</p>
