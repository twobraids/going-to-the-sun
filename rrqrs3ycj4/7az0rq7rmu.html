            <h2 id="Evaro,MT">Evaro, MT</h2>
<p>The real trouble started just after passing Joe's Smoke Ring, the tax free cigarette store on US93 near the south end of the Flathead Reservation north of Evaro, Montana. The foul smell of burning oil confirmed that I faced trouble. By the time that I got to Evaro, billowing smoke appeared in the rear view mirror. I eased over to the wide spot in front of the town's tiny roadside diner, lonely with no parked cars. I dropped into neutral, coasted to a stop and yanked the parking brake. Leaving it running, I popped the hood to see the source of the oil leak. The answer came easily: everywhere.</p>
<p>I got back in, pulled the key. The shaking motor died with a final backfire and likely no hope of ever starting again. The bluish white cloud, my own personal smoke screen, slowly dissipated. No roadside repair would heal this wound. I needed a tow truck. I looked under between the front wheels, hot oil had already started to pool.</p>
<p>The cafe’s twin "Closed" and "For Sale" signs mocked me. Scanning the diner's façade, the mount for a pay phone next to the door had no matching phone attached: no way to call for a tow. My motorcycle, ratchet strapped in the bed of the truck had no use either: I had no ramp to get it out. That mountain bike I abandoned at my cabin this morning would have been really useful right now. I sighed heavily as I resigned myself to hitchhiking down to the Wye at I-90 and call a tow truck from Missoula.</p>
<p>Standing there for several minutes frowning alternately at my truck and the shuttered cafe, my predicament apparently attracted the notice of a van traveling south. It pulled over, brakes squealing and skidding in the loose gravel on the shoulder.</p>
<p>The guy popped out with a cigarette hanging from his lips: shaggy strawberry blonde hair and a light, almost transparent, mustache and whispy beard. Probably about 24.  He tossed the cigarette to the gravel and gave it one twist of his boot. Rounding the back of his van, he called out, “You need help? I got tools.“</p>
<p>"I just need to get to a phone to call a tow truck. There's no fixing it here, it's gonna need a new engine."</p>
<p>"Wow, it is an F100, ‘71 or ‘72?” he asked. “Can I take a look?”</p>
<p>"Go ahead but I think that pool of oil ought to tell you all you need to know."</p>
<p>"Did the filter blow or is the pan punctured?" he asked as he stepped up and peered in, "Oh! I see what you mean. That's quite the crack, yeah, she's not going anywhere.  How many miles on her?"</p>
<p>"No idea. The odometer’s got only 5 digits and it hasn’t moved all day. Speedometer says it's going 40 right now."</p>
<p>Otto snorted a laugh. "No plates, did you just buy it?"</p>
<p>"The day before yesterday. I got it really cheap up in Browning on the Rez. I  just needed it to last long enough get me to Missoula. It did fine over Marias Pass, down the east side of Flathead Lake and through the Mission Valley. I started to wonder about it at Arlee."</p>
<p>"How much you pay?"</p>
<p>"$300,” I lied. The real deal was rough trade: Tom wanted his ass fucked. He got his fuck, I got his truck. Did this make a prostitute? As if I hadn't made deals like this over and over in the last five years. “I’m in it for the adventure,” I inadvertently muttered out loud as a rejoinder to my own thoughts.</p>
<p>"Shit, you almost made it. Only got fifteen miles away," he said as he started to walk around the truck. He spotted my Harley strapped in the long bed, "nice bike, man. You buy that yesterday, too?"</p>
<p>"No, that's my Wide Glide. I got it a couple years ago," I said.</p>
<p>Watching him, he ignored the bike and kept checking out the truck. He got down on the ground and inspected the undercarriage. After getting up again, he put both hands on the edge of the rear bed, jumped, putting his weight on his hands before jumping off again: testing the suspension.</p>
<p>Completing his walk around and examination, he said, "I'm heading into Missoula. I can give a ride to the Wye and you can call a tow truck.  But I think I've got a better deal for you. The chassis is really in descent shape for her age, there's not much rust, the suspension is tight even with the bike in back. Except for the rear right panel that bent passenger door, the body’s not that bad. I got an engine for her.”</p>
<p>"I'm not interested in repairing it. I was literally going to junk it when I got to Missoula."</p>
<p>”She doesn't deserve the junk yard. I'll take it off your hands for what you paid for it and tow it for free. We got two others of these fifth generation F100s in the back lot. With this one, I’ll have a project for next winter. With the three of them together, I can make one to sell for eleven maybe twelve thousand next Spring.</p>
<p>"My lucky day, I break down and I get picked up by the mad mechanic even before the smoke clears.  My name's Karl," I said while proffering my hand.</p>
<p>"I'm Otter. Spencer in real life, but even my mom calls me Otter," he replied after clasping my hand for a moment. "My family runs the Orange Street Garage. If you want to sit here with the truck and your bike, I'll head back to the shop, get the tow truck and come back and pick ya' up. Probably about an hour."</p>
<p>Chatty, a nervous kind of chatty, I wondered if he was on coke. When things are suddenly this convenient, I get suspicious, “Well this seems to be my lucky day.”</p>
<p>“Lucky day for me too. I just drove up to Joe’s to buy a few cartons of cigarettes for me and Dad,” he said as he pulled a pack from his shirt packet and tapped one out.</p>
<p>"Oh, I can't tow you with the bike in the back. You got a ramp to roll it out?"</p>
<p>"No, I used an old loading dock at the railroad station in East Glacier this morning. Once I got to Missoula, I figured I’d find a ramp somewhere."</p>
<p>"I'll bring a ramp. Move all your boxes into the cab. The truck bed has to tow empty.  I'll be back in an hour or so," he paused awaiting my agreement.</p>
<p>"Sure, lets do it," still suspicious, but it was the only deal in front of me and I hate hitchhiking.</p>
<p>He walked back to his van, jumped in, and took off down Evaro hill.</p>
<p>I walked around to the back of the truck, lowered the tailgate and started removing the bungee nets that secured the boxes that I had arranged tightly around the bike. I pulled them all out and spread them out on ground on the passenger side. Thinking of that new computer game, Tetris, I worried about getting all these boxes into the cab. I sat in the passenger seat thinking for probably thirty minutes: about how one could write a computer program to find an optimal arrangement of shapes in a 3D space. I often drift into my head space thinking about programming. So deeply inside my head, I startled when I heard tires on gravel. A county patrol car pulled up behind the truck.</p>
<p>“Got mechanical trouble?” The officer called to me as he stepped out of his car.</p>
<p>I hopped out of the passenger seat and turned to face him as he approached. “Yeah, cracked engine block. I’ve already gotten a tow truck coming.”</p>
<p>“I notice you have no plates on this vehicle.”</p>
<p>“I've been the owner of this piece of junk since day before yesterday. I’ve got the title and bill of sale in the glove compartment. You want to see them?"</p>
<p>“Yes, I do, but I’ll start with your drivers license.”</p>
<p>Okay, cooperate, be charming. “Certainly,” I said. I pulled my wallet from its chain on my belt loop, opened and pulled the license out. As I handed it to him, I read his name tag, “Sheriff Randy Blubaugh“. So the head of the department patrols rather than sitting at a desk all day.</p>
<p>“Step over to the patrol car,” he said gesturing for me to walk ahead of him. Never leave your back unprotected, I learned that from Dolph. Leaving me at his front bumper, he took my license inside the car to run my identity for warrants. Stretching his coiled Motorola cord to its limit, he contacted dispatch while standing behind his open car door. He broadcast my license details to anyone monitoring the frequency.</p>
<p>My gaze left the patrol car and wandered up the steep mountainsides to the east behind him. I recognized the west facing ski slopes of Snow Bowl, likely the Lavalle Creek lift. The peak at the top bristled with the antennas of the county, the city, several fire departments, three television stations, at least five radio stations, the forest service, the power company, the phone company, and the local ham radio club repeater. Beyond that, several hundred feet higher, the flat bulldozed peak of Point Six, still white with late season snow, sported the big geodesic globe of NOAA’s weather radar station. These two peaks served as the electromagnetic communication hub of Western Montana from Flathead Lake all the way south to Lost Trail Pass.</p>
<p>After a few exchanges with his radio, he brought back my license and handed it to me.  "Fetch that title and bill of sale for me."</p>
<p>The Sheriff followed me back to the passenger side door. I had to pull a couple boxes out to access the glove compartment.</p>
<p>"What you carrying in all these boxes?"</p>
<p>Cooperate, cooperate. “My life. I’m moving to Missoula for graduate school."</p>
<p>"Mind if I take a look?"</p>
<p>I gestured ascent without saying anything. Shit, shit, shit. Breaking my silence, I said, "There's a detailed inventory on the top of each box."</p>
<p>He started to look at the boxes and their neatly computer printed labels. He read through a couple of them and then looked at me as if asking what kind of freak does this.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know it’s a weird thing to do. I like organized things,” I said answering the question he had not asked.</p>
<p>"You carrying anything unlawful with you?"</p>
<p>I immediately thought of the pirated copy of Concurrent DOS, as he pulled open the box of electronics components, computer parts and floppy disks. "No, officer."</p>
<p>"What are these?" He asked about my stacks of floppy disks.</p>
<p>"Computer data and program storage. I'll be studying Software Engineering at the University in the Fall. I'm a computer programmer."</p>
<p>He turned his head to look at me. After a moment with what I took to be an incredulous stare, he skeptically said, "You don't look the part." He looked over another few boxes by-passing the ones marked clothing. I wondered how he'd react to my "Bitterroot Bastards" overlay if he found it. He on moved to another box labeled, "Bedroom" with its long list of items ending with "Tom's dildo.”  I doubt he noticed the label, but started picking items out to look under them. After a moment, he reflexively yanked his hand out and looked at it. I guessed that old dildo likely still had lube on it.</p>
<p>Just then, a vehicle coming up the hill audibly slowed, and we both turned to look. A rollback tow truck flipped on its flashing yellow hazard light bar, turned sharply, and pulled up perpendicular in front of my truck.</p>
<p>The sheriff, eyebrows knitted with concern, wiped his left hand with a handkerchief, and said, "I'll let you guys carry on with your business." He turned away from the dildo box, now vigorously scrubbing at his hand, and walked swiftly back to his patrol car.</p>
<p>Otter came up to me, "You got trouble?"</p>
<p>"Nah, but I think he does."</p>
<p>"Was that Blubough? Did he search you?"</p>
<p>"He started to, but I think he found something he didn’t want to see, let alone touch. Then you pulling in interrupted him."</p>
<p>"You better check to see if he pocketed anything. I've heard a lot of bad things about him. I suppose he didn't want me to witness what he was doing."</p>
<p>I snorted thinking of the sheriff pocketing the dildo. I looked over to the sheriff’s car as he was putting his radio handset down. His left turn signal came on, he paused to let a truck pass, and he pulled onto the highway, accelerating a bit more quickly than necessary.</p>
<p>Still holding the papers that the sheriff hadn't even bothered to look at, I tucked them back in the glove box. I returned to my 3D Tetris game with Otter's assistance. It was a tight fit, but we got all the boxes in. My material plane had shrunk over the years, I abandoned a lot of my stuff in my former East Glacier cabin.</p>
<p>Otter explained to me, "I brought the rollback truck so we can use it to get your bike off and the truck on easily. I'm going to back my truck up to the rear end of your truck and match the beds. Then you can walk the bike back onto the flatbed. I'll lower you to the ground.  Then when you've got the bike out of the way, we'll pull your truck up backwards and secure it. Technically, carrying her backwards isn't great, but there's not really enough room for me to maneuver in front of her, and she isn’t so heavy that she'll unbalance us." Man, this guy could talk, was he going to narrate everything he did?</p>
<p>I hopped up into the truck bed and start releasing the bike's ratchet straps. Meanwhile, Otter pulled his truck around, straightening his alignment with my truck. Making a level platform for me to back onto took only seconds. He made it easy for me so I wouldn't have to do the, always dicy, roll backwards down a ramp</p>
<p>It worked perfectly. With my bike on the ground and Otter working methodically to secure the truck, I divided my beard into two and braided each half. This way my braids streamed over each shoulder in the wind instead of flailing me in the face as a single braid would. Then I made a long braid down my back, tying it at the end so the wind wouldn't unravel it. I started the bike to let it idle to warm up while waiting for Otter.</p>
<p>Otter had an additional task: he spread what looked like cat litter all over my truck's spilled fluids. Once they soaked for a few minutes, he swept them into a container marked hazardous waste.</p>
<p>After checking one more time that the truck was secure, he put away his tools and hand-signaled he was ready to head out. Otter pulled the tow truck onto the highway, and I rolled my throttle. The powerful rip of my pipes brought me a smile, just as it always does.  I followed my ill-fated backwards truck into the Missoula Valley. We didn't hit I-90, but kept on the highway that was once US93 South and US10 East, now I-90 Business Loop.</p>
<p>Just beyond the airport, I followed Otter to a sprawling wrecking yard fronted by a four-bay auto shop. A low squat sign, conforming to the new modern sign ordinance, framing three lines of text, sat like a shrub near the entrance driveway: "Orange Street Garage; Broadway Auto Yard; Rent-a-Wreck." Apparently, they recently graduated from the tight confines of Orange Street in the center of town.</p>
<p>I pulled the bike up to the office while Otter pulled the laden tow truck through the gate into the back lot. I kicked the stand down, switched the bike off, leaned the bike onto the stand, then finally dismounted.</p>
<p>Immediately, a woman, probably early fifties, popped out the door and greeted me, “You must be the biker with the F100 that Otter was so excited about. I’m Gail, Gail Ottarstad, Otter’s mother. And, oh, look at you, those tattoos are wonderful—so complicated, is that Celtic?" she pronounced the word as if it started with an "S".</p>
<p>Just then, with a roar, a red tailed Northwest 727 rose into the air from the unseen runway beyond the auto salvage yard. It was close and loud enough to stop any conversation.  Gail stopped talking for the duration, smiling at me, apparently being used to this sort of interruption, and then started up again immediately.</p>
<p>"I don't think I've ever seen a man braid his beard like that. Did you do it yourself? Where'd you learn to braid?"</p>
<p>No doubt where Otter picked up his frenetic chattiness. He sounded just like his mother. She didn't wait for answers, I was at least three questions behind her. Maybe the whole family snorted coke.</p>
<p>Rewinding back to the beginning and interrupting her next question, I said, "I'm Karl, Karl Laugsson."</p>
<p>"Laugsson. That's an uncommon name. There's a law firm downtown with that name. Do you have relatives in town?"</p>
<p>Shit, I'm town for five minutes and someone has already connected me with my father. "I suppose its possible, I don't know," I deflected.</p>
<p>"Oh, I can help you figure that out. I love genealogy, I've traced our family all the way back to Norway in the 1800s."</p>
<p>"My focus has to be on right now. I need to figure out how to get rid of this truck, get my things stored somewhere, find a place to spend the night and find myself a meal."</p>
<p>Otter came back through the gate with a big smile."Mom can help with the paperwork to transfer the truck. She does all the title work here."</p>
<p>"Oh, do you really want to give up your truck?" Gail gave me a concerned look.</p>
<p>"I've literally had this truck for 48 hours. My buddy Tom essentially gave it to me. I was lucky to get it to last even halfway from Browning. Once I got it here and found a place to live, I was going to take it to a junk yard. The junk yard seems to have come to me."</p>
<p>"Browning? You mean on the Blackfeet Reservation?", Gail sounded shocked, "Isn't that dangerous?"</p>
<p>I didn't answer as Otter interrupted, "We don't want a salvage title on this truck. It's undercarriage is fine, the body needs work, engine is shot. I could use the engine from that blue one with the smashed rear end. This truck is the perfect find for my project."</p>
<p>Gail asked, "Did you sign the title?"</p>
<p>"No, Tom, the owner, got the notary and signed it. I did not sign it specifically so it would be easier to pass on someone else."</p>
<p>Gail smiled. "Perfect, this is really simple then. So, you have the title?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's in the glove box."</p>
<p>"Perfect, Otter, run and get it. Karl, come on inside."</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, the truck was out of my hands and officially owned by Orange Street Garage. Gail even made good with Otter's offer of $300 in cash. We prostitutes prefer cash transactions. I thought of Vince’s comment years ago when we first met about underselling myself for charging only twenty bucks for a blow job. Vince and Chris, goddamn but I miss them.</p>
<p>"So what's that sign out front, 'Rent-a-Wreck'?"</p>
