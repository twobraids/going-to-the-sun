            <h2 id="Psilocybin">Psilocybin</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The handful of dried mushrooms, mostly ash gray, but hints of yellow and greenish blue weighed nothing. I tossed them into my mouth and  chewed, the texture and taste of an old shower curtain with a heavy coat of mildew. Struggled with it, the urge to spit out grew hard to resist—distraction, just keep hiking—such a foul thing to eat. I swallowed after a couple hundred yards.</p>
<p>With North Half-Dome Craigs firmly in my view, I took off up the ridge. No trail here. The trees grew low and gnarled with a pronounced tendency to crowd all their branches to the east—brutal winds tear down the shoulders of the peaks of the Great Bear Wilderness to the west.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When I stopped for a break about forty minutes later, I relaxed into the mushroom buzz.  My body amazed me. My legs, levers linked end to end, with my own living meat coordinating the joints propelling this awkward vertical form up the mountainside.</p>
<p>I didn’t rest long, I felt compelled to keep the body moving. Living inside my skin—aware of tiny muscle groups throughout my body, cooperating to hold my balance while I climbed ever higher up the ridge.</p>
<p>Tripping hard—seeing patterns in everything. Spent a few minutes trying to decipher writing on a stone—lichens trying to speak to me.</p>
<p>I began choosing my path based on which muscles I wanted to feel working. The ridge line did not always ascend. The switch to downhill sections sent shivers through me as different muscle groups automatically took over—didn’t even have to think about it—it just happened.</p>
<p>I couldn’t keep to this ridge, it got too steep. The trees got shorter and shorter as I ascended the slope until they just gave up and I left them behind. Switched to open gravel or draws of rubble.</p>
<p>To get to the peak, I had to venture onto the open west face and start zig-zagging upward and a cross talus slopes, great chutes and angled planes of loose rock the size of serving platters. I was bad at it. I kept turning directly upslope in fascination with the sensations of my leg muscles, imaging the bundles of fibers, made of cells responding to nerves.</p>
<p>Talus—crazy stuff to walk on. I filled up with the musical dance of ceramic clinks as if I walked on stacks of dishes. The rocks all became glass shingles, matte sea glass, flat plates larger than my feet, pastel greens, yellows, blues. I slid and shifted with each step, my balance shifted as my arms shot outward to from my sides. With the mid afternoon sun warming my face, I laughed and laughed.</p>
<p>A movement caught my eye. Holy shit—somebody standing down slope, maybe a twenty yards. His face went from shadow to light. The sun brightened to a glare.</p>
<p>"Vince!" I leapt downhill at a run—how was he here? I slipped and slid on the glass, couldn’t get traction, as Vince turned and strode down and away. "No!  Vince, it's me. Stop!"</p>
<p>I lost my balance and tumbled onto the lichen crusted slope of rubble. I lay there for a moment afraid to look up, knowing in my heart that no one ran from me down slope. I’m tripping—not real. I shut my eyes.</p>
<p>The blood red glow, mandala patterns as my eyes darted around behind crusty eyelids, sunshine passing through veins. Don’t fall in—open the eyes—see what’s real.</p>
<p>I didn’t see what I expected. A post stood where I thought I had seen Vince, gray weathered wood.  I picked my self up and worked my way down to investigate. Just below the post, an old miner's cabin came into view, like the ground unfolded just to show me. The tumble of boulders buried the back end, but the front, canted downhill, seemed accessible.</p>
<p>Rounding to the front of the decrepit shack, I stepped gingerly onto the  gray wood porch—felt sound. I peered into through the door hanging from rusty broken hinges—too dark for detail.</p>
<p>I stepped in, deep dust on the floor, bluish dry mineral smell in the air.</p>
<p>A man and a woman sitting at a dusty table looked up at me as I stepped in. They both erupted in smiles, thought it was Mary and Tom,  but then not. The guy looked like a miner, dirty clothes, smudges of black coal on his face. Figured she was his wife, dressed in an old fashioned gingham dress, checked pink and white.</p>
<p>"I knew you’d eventually come back." The guy stood up from his seat and pulled out a chair for me. I approached cautiously, not sure if I knew him.</p>
<p>Beyond the table, I could see out a window, a view down into a valley riddled with the gantries over vertical shaft hard rock mines—hundreds of them. I turned around and looked out the door—like a scene from Butte at the turn of the century, all smoke, and torn up earth. I was in the Badger-Two Medicine, mining never happened here.</p>
<p>"How hard did I fall?" My own whispered voice hung in the air as if it didn’t know where to go.</p>
<p>Feeling dizzy, I took the seat he offered me at the table. His grin became a leer, sexual—animal. The woman held out a deck of cards to me. I took them and she grinned like that meant she’d won the pot.</p>
<p>I began to shuffle and found my self in the box at a poker table. The man on my left and the woman on my right. Five Bastards sat in front of me, Rooster, Slim, Whiskey, Stitch, and… I binked hard… Acid. Those pale blue eyes bored into me. I dealt out the hole cards, then the door cards face up.</p>
<p>They weren't playing cards, not even tarot cards—different—intricate line drawings like Dolph’s notepads, but with hashed shading and sparse color, depicting miners working. I kept dealing, fourth street, fifth street, not waiting for the players' bets. The cards changed as I spun out the deck. Sexual scenes, men and women fucking, men and men fucking, men fucking animals. I dropped the deck on the table.</p>
<p>The cards became crows, exploding from the table into the air. They raised dust clouds as they circled the room and out the door—dusty blue odor and yellow fear. I sneezed.</p>
<p>I heard my own voice—tiny, distant—like from a deep well. "I'm supposed to be climbing a mountain."</p>
<p>"You're s’posed to be ridin’ your own road."</p>
<p>I whipped my head to the left. Vince sat there, the eye under the angry slash of his scar meeting mine.</p>
<p>My hand clapped to my own scabbed wound. I traced his scar with my eye, but I felt my own, above my eyebrow, across my temple and into my hairline. All the pain exploded back—the bright flash of Cherry's shotgun.</p>
<p>The great maw of a grizzly lunged at me, the smell of mildew, foul breath all brown and dead.  I dropped and rolled on the talus—the clinking of rocks against each other.  I sprawled on the rocks, my face to the sky.</p>
<p>No bear, no Vince, no cabin.</p>
<p>Gotta turn this around—not the place for a bad trip. This is wrong, never had mushrooms affect me like this—supposed to see patterns, not full on hallucinations. That's an angel dust thing—like Gauge's freak out on the night of the Ghost River Clan's fight.</p>
<p>I struggled back to my feet, facing downhill. Pain told me that my right ankle twisted. Looking down, blood trickled down from my left knee—nothing I couldn’t do about either now. First aid kit’s back at Bison Lakes camp.</p>
<p>Looking back up to the peak, the talus took on the lobed flow patterns of glacial ice. The whole mountain flowed down into the valley below—a slow motion melting candle—no wick, no flame—just the burning white of icy snow.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Not angel dust. Not angel dust." My chant seemed futile, disconnected—my words smelled of sulphur. I said the word outloud, “Synesthesia.” It swirled around and squeezed my head—bile yellow, some sort of disease.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Enough!” My shout knocked me back onto the empty talus slope below the peak. Took me a while ground myself and resume my ascent.</p>
<p>The talus gave way to larger and larger boulders. Ahead, a wall of rock clothed in splotches of black, putty green, and rusty orange lichen—dancing symbols on the rock that I still couldn’t read.</p>
<p>As the rocks got larger and larger toward the peak, I resorted to leaping. Each launch, the feel of the hard muscle, brought me right back to the kickstarter of the rat bike, that final test by the Bastards.</p>
<p>A full brother for only two months—my time in the Bastards was only two months.</p>
<p>"You never did take to ridin' in formation."</p>
<p>I looked around, but did not see Vince.</p>
<p>I took shelter in cleft between a boulder that barely cleaved to its twin brother. A patch of snow survived in the shade, lightly touched with watermelon pink.</p>
<p>I pulled off my right boot to inspect my paining ankle. Minor swelling, a bit tender to the touch. The left knee, didn't look too bad on close inspection. I licked my finger, rubbed line of dried blood on my shin, then returned my finger to my mouth, amused that I tasted myself.</p>
<p>A pika, alpine rock rabbit, scampered into the open, froze, staring at me with beady black eyes, then vanished back under the rocks.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I edged around the highest boulder looking for the route up.  Only the south side gave me access, but with a trap. A dizzying shear headwall opened in front of me, a thousand foot drop into a cirque with a turquoise glacial lake.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>This route to the top took a steep crumbly crack choked with loose rock just up from the precipice. I looked for the foot and hand holds, nothing stable. Tracing the fall line, I imaging flailing down the chute and over the edge. Tripping—am I even seeing this right?</p>
<p>Nope, can't get to the very top.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0048" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I wasn't disappointed. Not as if twenty feet made much difference in the view. I gazed south to the open maw of the South Craigs cirque. The ridge line extended two miles, a link between the two peaks—could be hikable, but not my path today.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Retreating to the twin rocks, I spotted what I had missed earlier. I could chimney up the crack between them, then just step over to the peak. The route seemed to glow in front of me.</p>
<p>I just did it. Bracing my back on one rock, my feet on the other, I ascended in discrete stages, once side, then other, repeated ten or twelve times.</p>
