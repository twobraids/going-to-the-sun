            <h2 id="Psilocybin">Psilocybin</h2>
<p>The handful of dried mushrooms, mostly ash gray, but hints of yellow and greenish blue weighed nothing. I tossed them into my mouth and  chewed, the texture and taste of an old shower curtain with a heavy coat of mildew. Struggled with it, the urge to spit out grew hard to resist—distraction, just keep hiking—such a foul thing to eat. I swallowed after a couple hundred yards.</p>
<p>With North Half-Dome Craigs firmly in my view, I took off up the ridge. No trail here. The trees grew low and gnarled with a pronounced tendency to crowd all their branches to the east—brutal winds tear down the shoulders of the peaks of the Great Bear Wilderness to the west.</p>
<p>When I stopped for a break about forty minutes later, I relaxed into the mushroom buzz.  My body amazed me. My legs, levers linked end to end, with my own living meat coordinating the joints propelling this awkward vertical form up the mountainside.</p>
<p>I didn’t rest long, I felt compelled to keep the body moving. Living inside my skin—aware of tiny muscle groups throughout my body, cooperating to hold my balance while I climbed ever higher up the ridge.</p>
<p>Tripping hard—seeing patterns in everything. Spent a few minutes trying to decipher writing on a stone—lichens trying to speak to me.</p>
<p>I began choosing my path based on which muscles I wanted to feel working. The ridge line did not always ascend. The switch to downhill sections sent shivers through me as different muscle groups automatically took over—didn’t even have to think about it—it just happened.</p>
<p>I couldn’t keep to this ridge, it got too steep. The trees got shorter and shorter as I ascended the slope until they just gave up and I left them behind. Switched to open gravel or draws of rubble.</p>
<p>To get to the peak, I had to venture onto the open west face and start zig-zagging upward and a cross talus slopes, great chutes and angled planes of loose rock the size of serving platters. I was bad at it. I kept turning directly upslope in fascination with the sensations of my leg muscles, imaging the bundles of fibers, made of cells responding to nerves.</p>
<p>Talus—crazy stuff to walk on. I filled up with the musical dance of ceramic clinks as if I walked on stacks of dishes. The rocks all became glass shingles, matte sea glass, flat plates larger than my feet, pastel greens, yellows, blues. I slid and shifted with each step, my balance shifted as my arms shot outward to from my sides. With the mid afternoon sun warming my face, I laughed and laughed.</p>

<p>I struggled back to my feet, facing downhill. Pain told me that my right ankle twisted. Looking down, blood trickled down from my left knee—nothing I couldn’t do about either now. First aid kit’s back at Bison Lakes camp.</p>
<p>Looking back up to the peak, the talus took on the lobed flow patterns of glacial ice. The whole mountain flowed down into the valley below—a slow motion melting candle—no wick, no flame—just the burning white of icy snow.</p>
<p>"Not angel dust. Not angel dust." My chant seemed futile, disconnected—my words smelled of sulphur. I said the word outloud, “Synesthesia.” It swirled around and squeezed my head—bile yellow, some sort of disease.</p>
<p>“Enough!” My shout knocked me back onto the empty talus slope below the peak. Took me a while ground myself and resume my ascent.</p>
<p>The talus gave way to larger and larger boulders. Ahead, a wall of rock clothed in splotches of black, putty green, and rusty orange lichen—dancing symbols on the rock that I still couldn’t read.</p>
<p>As the rocks got larger and larger toward the peak, I resorted to leaping. Each launch, the feel of the hard muscle, brought me right back to the kickstarter of the rat bike, that final test by the Bastards.</p>
<p>A full brother for only two months—my time in the Bastards was only two months.</p>
<p>"You never did take to ridin' in formation."</p>
<p>I looked around, but did not see Vince.</p>
<p>I took shelter in cleft between a boulder that barely cleaved to its twin brother. A patch of snow survived in the shade, lightly touched with watermelon pink.</p>
<p>I pulled off my right boot to inspect my paining ankle. Minor swelling, a bit tender to the touch. The left knee, didn't look too bad on close inspection. I licked my finger, rubbed line of dried blood on my shin, then returned my finger to my mouth, amused that I tasted myself.</p>
<p>A pika, alpine rock rabbit, scampered into the open, froze, staring at me with beady black eyes, then vanished back under the rocks.</p>
<hr>
<p>I edged around the highest boulder looking for the route up.  Only the south side gave me access, but with a trap. A dizzying shear headwall opened in front of me, a thousand foot drop into a cirque with a turquoise glacial lake.</p>
<p>This route to the top took a steep crumbly crack choked with loose rock just up from the precipice. I looked for the foot and hand holds, nothing stable. Tracing the fall line, I imaging flailing down the chute and over the edge. Tripping—am I even seeing this right?</p>
<p>Nope, can't get to the very top.</p>
<p>I wasn't disappointed. Not as if twenty feet made much difference in the view. I gazed south to the open maw of the South Craigs cirque. The ridge line extended two miles, a link between the two peaks—could be hikable, but not my path today.</p>
<p>Retreating to the twin rocks, I spotted what I had missed earlier. I could chimney up the crack between them, then just step over to the peak. The route seemed to glow in front of me.</p>
<p>I just did it. Bracing my back on one rock, my feet on the other, I ascended in discrete stages, once side, then other, repeated ten or twelve times.</p>
