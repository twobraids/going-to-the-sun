<p>After five days with Ted and Maggie, I rode north out of Augusta—no club colors. Didn't want anyone associating the club with their house.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>At the bridge over the Sun River, I pulled onto the gravel fishing access road. Space for only a couple vehicles on hard pack gravel. I got off the bike, couldn't see the river. Willows crowded the bank from the bridge abutment forty yards down river where a gap gave fishermen a way in. A half mile on, the battered concrete of the old highway bridge lay as rubble on its side, shoved from the alignment by the great flood of '64. Last time I stood here, I was an amazed eight year old listening to my father’s stories about the rain and floods that devastated all the western states that year.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I imagined standing on the bridge watching that flash flood, the water cutting off the road at both ends—no escape, the flow rising over the painted centerline—over the ankles, the bridge rolling over—arms flailing for balance, concrete cracking, sharp as rifle shots—darkness under the muddy flow, then crushing silence—heavy, endless.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I yanked myself out of the reverie with an angry bark. A red-winged blackbird called back with an extended half music, half metal, "coke-a-reeeee".</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Snapped the right saddle bag open, felt the heat from the pipes beneath. I pulled out my Bitterroot Bastards cut, shook it once. Threaded my arm through and pulled it onto my back.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The bird flitted between willow branches keeping a beady black eye on me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Back on the bike—fired up the engine.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The bird fled over willows across the river.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A quick u-turn spitting gravel, I popped back onto the highway. Ascending the northern side of the river canyon, I let the pipes rip, shifting hard, leaving only my echo in the empty valley.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The rest of my ride home honored Vince. Proud to wear my colors, cruising north on the Blackfeet lands that no club bothered to claim.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Couple hours north, I saw Mollies Nipple Road flash by, so, of course, David invaded my head. A few minutes later, I slowed for the Heart Butte Cutoff—not the fastest route home. At the last minute, I rolled the bike left toward David's Heart Butte cabin.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Thirty minutes later I slowed and stopped at his road. The brush had grown over it, not quite blocking it, but leaving just enough space to thread the bike through. Took me ten minutes to decide to ride up.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The cabin stood largely as David left it last year, but everything overgrown and rank. The cabin door still stood open.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I parked the bike about where I had parked the Honda that day. In honor of my own foresight on that day, I jockeyed the bike around to face outward.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Like the legions mice, squirrels, chipmunks, raccoons, and at least one bear, I stepped into the half lit cabin.  The bottle on the table caught my eye first. Looked like a rag stuffed into it. I stepped closer—a book of matches: Vince’s Iron Horse. This was the threat that Vince said he and Dolph left. David probably never saw it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I toured the rest of the room—bed frame with no mattress, kitchen cabinets open or broken, raccoon foot prints on the tables and sink. An empty space across from the table instead of that ragged blue couch where I gave David head.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I returned to the table, picked up the bottle. "Hey Vince, the Molotov cocktail doesn't work without fuel." My voice sounded dull and closed in.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Shaking my head, I walked back out, sat at the picnic table facing my bike remembering that terrible day. Such an idiot, such a fucking supplicant playing David's fire. But goddamn him for taking it out on me. “Hey David, checkout the cocksucker that rides your bike now!”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My voice sounded just as hollow as it did inside.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I felt the surging anger, my teeth clenched. I stomped back into the cabin, grabbed the bottle and pulled the cloth out—the smell of bad gas—wicked out and evaporated over the year.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pissed into the narrow opening of the bottle. I held it up to the light, not quite the right color for gasoline, but it would do. I wanted my tag alongside Vince's.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Here, David, you haven't finished your whiskey. Drink up." I growled—I sounded like a fucking madman.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stuffed the rag back in the bottle and slammed it back onto the table.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Stormed back out to my bike—done with this place.</p>
<p>Back out on the highway a few minutes later, I felt a breeze and looked down. I hadn't put my dick away. Using my clutch hand, I pushed it back into my pants and got the zipper at least half way up.</p>
<h2 id="RailroadCreekRanch">Railroad Creek Ranch</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned off US2 on to Railroad Creek Ranch as the sun dipped below the western mountains—nervous—didn't feel safe to go straight to my cabin. As I approached the fork—left to the restaurant, right to my cabin, I looked hard at the road dust. Marked. Truck tires. I kept moving left. I rode all the way to Gladys’s restaurant and parked next to customer cars.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It sounded like she kicked the door open. Gladys rushed down the steps toward me. "Goddamn you, Karl. Worried about you. I kept waitin' for you to come down." She shook her head. "You've been gone for more'n a week. Why didn't you call me?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked at her in confusion—I've ever called her.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She stepped up, pulled me into a hug—all padding and straps, like getting hugged by a sofa—she wore a girdle—scent of soap and kitchen grease. She'd never so much as touched me since I met her three years ago. She was the landlady, not my grandmother.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Once she finally drew back, her eyes settled on the healing scabs on my forehead. "You got hurt in the fire?"</p>
<p>I shook my head. "I wasn't there. Was at my camp up at Bison Lakes that weekend. Didn't even know it happened until I showed up for work last Friday. It was just gone. ...everyone was gone."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She pursed her lips. None of the usual gravel in her voice. "You know about Vince?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I hesitated, broke her gaze by looking down. "Yeah, I know."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Oh, Karl." The upholstery hug again. "He really took you under his wing, didn't he?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Poker face.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When she pulled away, her brows went down seeing she wouldn't get a response. She frowned, changed the subject for me. "Listen. Last Saturday, I saw a truck head up your road. Never saw it come back down."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I scanned the forest behind the guest cabins, up the gully then across where my cabin sat hidden in the trees. I nodded to Gladys, reprising my plan to scope it out before I approached my cabin.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I'll hike up there and check it out." I opened saddle bags, shoved clothing into the backpack and slung it over my shoulder. "I'm gonna leave the bike here."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Let me make dinner for you. Tell me what happened, where you've been."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shook my head, still looking at the woods. "Nah, I don't need it. I'll come back down tomorrow. I just need to sleep."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I walked away without another glance at her.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Didn’t take my path. I walked the gully next to the stream—the water noise would cover any sounds I made. Once I got to the old snag bridge, I crossed over to the other side and connected with the last thirty yards of my trail. I crept toward my woodshed, moving slowly, scanning all around. My dusty Subaru came into sight. I froze for a full minute listening.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>No truck sat in front of the cabin, but clearly the tracks said someone had turned around here.</p>
<p>I walked around to the back door, carefully watching for footprints or anything out of place. I tried the doorknob—still locked. Unlocked it, stepped in.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A thick manilla envelope on my table—first thing I saw. That kind with two round tabs and a waxed red thread to secure it—the type Sarah always used. Somebody from the MC had been here.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I almost ripped it open but caught myself, kept my hands off it.</p>
<p>Still not trusting my own home, I stepped slowly through the kitchen—nothing out of place. I walked to the front door—still locked.  Lower bedroom—clear. The loft—untouched.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I climbed back down and stood facing the folder on the table. I pulled on the thread—Sarah had wrapped it—counter clockwise on the top—opposite of what felt right. Dumped the contents: two sheets of paper and a shitload of cash.</p>
<p>The first paper, in Sarah's hand: "Wages for July."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0051" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked down at the cash, a bundle about the thickness of a deck of cards. No way I earned that much in July.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0052" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The second, in Chris's hand: "Any of the Forester MC chapters will honor your patch. Vince loved you. Ride with your colors. Wear the earring."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned it over—nothing more. Nothing about where they were. Neither of them even said good-bye. I missed them—they'd been here.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0054" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Felt like I veered off the highway, my stomach clenched, my head spun as it came clear.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>They paid me off. They're gone. I've been thrown out again.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0056" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Just like my father kicked me out four years ago. They've all mucked me like a losing poker hand.</p>
<p>My fury exploded like a firebomb. I yelled. I shrieked.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I kicked out my back door breaking the screen door hinges... stormed up the trail... past the fire ring... up to the glade with the beaver ponds...  the slap of a beavertail on the water... out to my log... I laid down and waited for the stars.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0059" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I slept on the ground with only the sky over me. I dreamed of a grizzly bear finishing the job.</p>
