            </div>
                  
            <h2 id="US289">US289</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After five days with Ted and Maggie, I rode north out of Augusta—no club colors. Didn't want anyone associating the club with their house.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>At the bridge over the Sun River, I pulled onto the gravel fishing access road. I got off the bike, and stood looking at the river. Far downriver, I spotted the battered concrete of the old highway bridge, shoved from the alignment a half mile by the great flood of 1964. I lingered on the our 1968 family trip where my father pointed it out.</p>
<p>Opened the right saddle bag, the hot one sitting just over the pipes. I pulled my warm Bitterroot Bastards vest out. Threaded my arm through and pulled it onto my back.</p>
<p>I remounted and started the bike. A quick u-turn spitting gravel, I popped back onto the highway. Ascending the northern river canyon side, I let the pipes rip, shifting with precision, leaving only my echo in the empty valley.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The rest of my ride home honored Vince. Proud to wear my colors. A lone flag bearer cruising north in territory that no club claimed.</p>
<p>Riding for the next couple hours, detoured through Heart Butte. I approached David’s old dirt road, slowed, then stopped.  The brush had grown over it, not quite blocking it, but leaving just about a bike width. I turned and rode up the remaining path.</p>
<p>The cabin stood largely as David probably left it, but everything overgrown and rank. I parked the bike about where I had parked the Honda that day. I turned the bike around to face outward.</p>
<p>The cabin door still stood open.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I like many rodents before me, I stepped into the gloom looking around with twitchy movements. The bottle on the table caught my eye. Looked like a rag stuffed into it. I stepped closer and noticed the book of matches.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I checked out the rest of the room—bed frame with no mattress, kitchen cabinets open or broken, raccoon foot prints on the counters.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I walked back to the table and looked out the window. I could see the picnic table and turned intending to go out there.  The matchbook on table distracted me, the Iron Horse logo.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>This was the threat that Vince said he and Dolph left. David probably never saw it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Hey Vince, the Molotov cocktail doesn't work without fuel in the bottle." My voice sounded dull and closed in. I wondered if whiskey would burn like gas.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Shaking my head, I walked back out, sat on the table's bench remembering that terrible day. I was such an idiot, such a fucking supplicant playing with fire. But goddamn him for taking it out on me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I felt the anger, my teeth clenched, but an idea pushed my cheeks into a paradoxical smile. I stomped back into the cabin, grabbed the bottle and pulled the cloth out.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Just moments later, I pissed into the narrow opening of David's discarded whiskey bottle. About ten ounces. I held it up to the light, not quite the right color for gasoline, but this is symbolic, I want my tag alongside Vince's.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Here, David, you haven't finished your whiskey. Drink up." I growled—I sounding like a fucking madman.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Storming back out to my bike, I was done with this place.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Back out on the highway a few minutes later, I felt a breeze and looked down. I hadn't put my dick away. Using my clutch hand, I pushed it back into my pants and got the zipper at least half way up.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="RailroadCreekRanch">Railroad Creek Ranch</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned off US2 on to Railroad Creek Ranch—nervous—didn't feel safe to go straight to my cabin. As I approached the fork—left to the restaurant, right to my cabin, I looked hard at the road dust. Marked. Truck tires. I kept moving left. I rode all the way to Gladys’s restaurant and parked next to customer cars.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It sounded like she kicked the door open. Gladys rushed down the steps toward me. "Goddamn you, Karl. I've been so worried about you. I kept waitin' for you to come down." She shook her head. "You've been gone for more'n a week. Why didn't you call me?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked at her in confusion—don't think I've ever called her for anything.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She stepped up and hugged me, holding me close for an uncomfortable few seconds. Once she drew back, her eyes settled on the healing scabs on my forehead. "You got hurt in the fire?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shook my head. "I wasn't there. Was at my camp up at Bison Lakes that weekend. Didn't even know it happened until I showed up for work last Friday. It was just gone. ...everyone was gone."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You know about Vince?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I hesitated, then turned my face away from her toward the ground. "Yeah, I know."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Oh, Karl." I endured another awkwardly long hug. "That time he stopped by for coffee, he spoke very highly of you."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Poker face.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When she pulled away, her brows went down and she frowned. "Listen, Karl. Last Saturday, I saw a truck go up your road. Didn't see it come back down."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I nodded, reprising my plan to take my trail across the gully to scope it out before approaching the cabin.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Didn’t take my path to my cabin. I walked the gully next to the stream—the water noise would cover any sounds I made. Once I got to the old snag bridge, I crossed over to the other side and connected with the last thirty yards of my trail. I crept toward my woodshed, moving slowly, scanning all around. My dusty Subaru came into sight. I froze for a full minute listening.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>No truck sat in front of the cabin, but clearly someone had turned around here.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I walked around to the back door, carefully watching for footprints or anything out of place. I tried the doorknob—still locked. Unlocked it, stepped in.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The manilla envelope on my table caught my eye—that kind with two tabs and a waxed red thread to secure it. The type Sarah always used. Somebody had gotten inside.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Still not trusting my own home, I stepped slowly through the kitchen—nothing out of place. I walked to the front door—still locked.  Lower bedroom—clear. The loft—untouched.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I climbed back down and stood facing the folder on the table. I twisted the thread loose. I dump the contents: two sheets of paper and bunch of cash.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The first paper, in Sarah's hand: "Wages for July."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The second, in Chris's hand: "Any of the Forester MC chapters will honor your patch. Vince really loved you. I think he saw a lot of himself in you. Ride with your colors and wear the earring."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned it over—nothing more. Nothing about where they were. Neither of them even said good-bye.  Where the fuck are they?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Felt like I fell into a deep well, my stomach lurched, my head spun as the truth cut into me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I've been thrown out again.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>How could they do this? Just like my father sending me away. They mucked me like a losing poker hand.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My fury exploded like a firebomb. I yelled. I shrieked.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Storming out my back door... climbed the trail past the fire ring... up to the glade with the beaver ponds...  the slap of a beavertail on the water... out to my log... watched the day fade... evening... dusk... twilight... night...</p>
<p><b><span id="U0048" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I slept on the ground under the stars.</p>
