            </div>
                  
            <p><b><span id="U0000" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I woke up several times during the night—first couple times—delirious—couldn't tell where I was, maybe not even who I was. Just felt the compulsion to run—get away. I think once I shouted out. I remember a face leering over me and a wash of fear—likely Maggie, just being a nurse.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dawn now—I remember all of it. I gotta go—got keep running—I've wrecked everything, can't let it spread here. My leathers hung over the chair across the room. I could just sneak out—leave these good people in peace. Shouldn't have come here.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My head throbbed as I pulled myself out of bed. I reached up and felt the huge bandage on the side of my head. I imagined trying to keep it in place in the wind of the highway. No solution for that came to me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I dressed as quickly as I could, fighting that headache.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I poked my head out the bedroom into the hallway and looked both directions. I could see the kitchen lights from down the hall—my only exit. Okay—no sneaking—if Ted's there, I’ll just thank him and go. I stepped out and headed down the hallway.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Emerging into the light, I saw Ted at the dinette table, waiting for me—grave, intent.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Good morning, Karl.” He paused for my response.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I struggled with what to say, feeling flustered and slow. Nothing came out.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Here's the deal, Karl. I'm not going to stop you if you leave right now. You’re free to go. But in about two hours, I'm gonna call the sheriff."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stood there at the end of the table, wearing the riding leathers he had given me—determined to ride out. To where? Is my cabin a safe place to go? I looked to the doorway to the garage, and heaved a deep sigh. Goddamn, but my head hurt.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Maggie says you still need medical help. She can provide it. I want you stay here and explain this. There's a big chunk of this story I don't know.  I need to figure out what I need to do next. You either need protection or you need arresting.” He reached up and rubbed his forehead. “That's two different phone calls. What you say will tell me which call I make.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pulled the closest chair out from the table. I sat down, shut my eyes. When I reopened them a moment later, it took them way too long to refocus on Ted. Couldn’t I ride if I tried.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Karl, where is David?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>That startled me, not what I expected. I sat with it for a moment, grasping for the connection. “What does David have to do with this?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Ted frowned. “David disappeared last fall. We were supposed have a hunting trip at his place in October. The cabin was ransacked, almost everything gone.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Saw him in September, maybe. Last time I was at his cabin, he was moving out. Said your hunting trip had been cancelled.” I thought for a moment, he had said something odd, a term I didn’t understand. I couldn’t remember.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Why do you have his bike?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Not his bike anymore. I bought it at the Glacier County sheriff's auction last November. I got the registration here in my jacket."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Show me."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pulled my wallet out of the left breast pocket of my jacket. Flipped it open, ruffled through some bills until I found the heavily folded registration document.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Show you papers, please—how would David have reacted to this?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He wrote the VIN on a notepad. "I’m gonna verify this. Not surprised the state seized his bike, that no tax sovereign citizen scam. What does surprise me is you’re the one ended up buyin’ it." He fell silent for a moment of thinking.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“How’d you even find out about the sale? You know it was going to happen?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shook my head. “I didn’t want it.” I clenched my teeth to stop myself.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Son, that doesn't make much sense. You want to try again?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I almost vomited the words, “They said it was justice. Said David owed it to me.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Who said that?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“David got into trouble with the Bastards. He beat up two prostitutes under their protection. That night we played poker at the Horse… he took Linda back to the motel. Beat her bad. He ran. That's why he wasn’t there when you woke up."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Ted looked shocked, but then gritted his teeth. “He did that to his ex-wife, too. Jesus, what’s wrong with him?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Last year, a week after your backyard barbecue where everybody freaked out about me—David beat the crap out of me.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Wait, you said there were two hookers.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Yep.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It took Ted a moment to chew on that.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned off US2 on to Railroad Creek Ranch—nervous—can’t go straight to my cabin. Looked like truck tire tracks in the dust up my road, so I rode all the to Gladys’s restaurant and parked next to couple cars.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Didn’t take the direct path—walked the in the gully next to the stream—the water noise would cover any sounds I made. Once I got to old snag bridge, I crossed over to the other side and connected with my trail. Slowly I crept toward my woodshed and my Subaru. As my view opened up I recognized Dolph’s truck in front of my porch.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I gasped and bolted out of the forest into the open. “Dolph! Dolph! Where are you?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Here.” His voice came from behind me, I whipped around. He’d been standing in the woodshed, I had run right by him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He didn’t look good—dark circles under his eyes, bruise on the side of his head and a bandage on his left hand.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I held back from approaching him, thinking about Cherry.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Vince is gone."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My voice hitched. "I know." I started shaking all over again.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph closed the distance, put his hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Deep breath—hold it back—</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Vince left us all jobs. Your’s is the last one." He gestured to the Ironhead Sporty on the trailer. "Keep it for Ed. If he wants it, give it back to him, otherwise, it’s yours."</p>
