<p>I laughed at them as the waitress walked away from the table. Slim and Yogi turned to look at me. Dolph gave me side eye.</p>
<p>I kept chuckling and shaking my head at all of them around the table.</p>
<p>"What?" Rooster scowled at me.</p>
<p>"You guys, put your eyes back in their sockets." I paused to chuckle. "Yeah, she's got big tits. You guys could barely stutter out your orders staring at her boobs."</p>
<p>"Oh, fuck you, Two Braids." Gauge dismissed me.</p>
<p>"She's flaunting them, she wants us to look." Rooster declared.</p>
<p>I smiled at him. "I hope that means you tip big. She's leveraging her natural assets to pry into your wallet."</p>
<p>Slim spit out a negation. "They ain't natural. She bought 'em from one of those plasticy surgery doctors. Boob job."</p>
<p>Rooster challenged me. "Hell, you telling me you didn't look, too? That's bullshit, no man wouldn't look."</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah, I saw 'em.  I suppose I appreciated them. But I'm not gonna dream about them tonight like you guys are."</p>
<p>That got all of them shaking their heads, interrupting each other to deny my observation.</p>
<p>I pushed on them harder. "Every one of you is gonna lie in you bedroll tonight holding onto your hard-on thinkin' about her."</p>
<p>"and you're not?" Gauge challenged me.</p>
<p>"Of course, not. I'm not wired like you guys are." I scanned their faces around the table before I drew the knot closed. "Listen, you guys like tits, that great, more power to you. Well you ought to know that beards are to me what big jugs are to you."</p>
<p>That shut them up. They sat there dumbfounded, looking stunned.</p>
<p>As if they had choreographed it, all of them but Dolph raised their hands to their beards to block my few.</p>
<p>I burst out laughing at them again.</p>
<p>Rooster spoke up after lowering his hand. "Ignore the fucker, he's just trying to get your goat."</p>
<p>"Get it? I think I already got it." I smiled at him. "I'm not givin' it back."</p>
<p>The waitress came back to the table at that moment with the beers. Everyone shut up while she gave out the beers. Only Slim leered at her tits. The rest of them, seemed suddenly more polite about it.</p>
<p>Gauge kept looking at me with his brow furrowed. "I don' get it. Your girl friends got bigger some of the biggest tits I've seen. That why you aren't impressed with this gal?"</p>
<p>"Girl friend? You mean Lonna?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, that other card dealer."</p>
<p>"She not my girl friend."</p>
<p>Gauge laughed. "You're always together. I've never understood how you stand for her hooking up with other guys."</p>
<p>"The same way that she accepts that I hook up with guys for cash, too."</p>
<p>"What the fuck?" He shook his head. "You're always yanking on everyone's chain. Be fuckin' serious for a moment."</p>
<p>I looked around the table, several of the guys suddenly got interested in looking at the other customers or the out the front window.</p>
<p>Rooster spoke up. "Gauge, you're already way in over your head."</p>
<p>I nodded to Rooster, then turned to Gauge."You and I haven't ever really interacted much. Maybe you didn't notice, I work for Sarah way more than I work for Snake."</p>
