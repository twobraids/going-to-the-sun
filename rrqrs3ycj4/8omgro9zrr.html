            <h2 id="Darby,MT">Darby, MT</h2>
<p>———> Karl participates in a ride in a big loop around Western Montana outlining the most of the territory claimed by the Bastards ten years earlier- US2 West to Troy, south to St Regis, I90 to Missoula, US93 South to MT43, East through Wise River to Butte, I90 to Three Forks, US287 to Helena, US12 West, MT141 North, MT200 West, MT83 North to Big Fork and Columbia Falls to report. Missing from the ride, Dillion, Twin Bridges, West Yellowstone, Bozeman.</p>
<p>———> This isn't working - rethink the whole thing...</p>
<p>I laughed at them as the waitress walked away from the table. Slim and Yogi turned to look at me. Dolph gave me side eye.</p>
<p>I kept chuckling and shaking my head at all of them around the table.</p>
<p>"What?" Rooster scowled at me.</p>
<p>"Put your goddamn eyes back in their sockets." I paused to chuckle. "Yeah, she's got big tits. You guys could barely stutter out your orders staring at her boobs."</p>
<p>"Oh, fuck you." Stitch dismissed me.</p>
<p>"She's flaunting them, she wants us to look." Rooster declared.</p>
<p>I smiled at him. "She's leveraging her natural assets to pry into your wallet."</p>
<p>"Them ain’t natural." Slim shook his head. "She ordered ’em out a catalog… one’a them boob job things."</p>
<p>Gauge challenged me. "Hell, you sayin’ you didn't look, too? That's bullshit, no man wouldn't look."</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah, I saw 'em. I suppose I appreciated them. But I'm not gonna dream about them tonight like the rest of you guys are." I pushed on him harder. "Every guy here is gonna lie in his bedroll tonight holding onto his hard-on thinkin' about her."</p>
<p>“And you're not?" Gauge challenged me.</p>
<p>Rooster spoke up after lowering his hand. "Ignore the fucker, Gauge. He's trying to get your goat."</p>
<p>"Get it? I already got it." I smiled at him. "You’re not gettin' it back."</p>
<p>———> the waitress needs to be more than tits and a serving tray</p>
<p>The waitress came back to the table at that moment with the beers. Everyone shut up while she gave out the beers. Only Slim obviously leered at her tits. The rest of them, seemed more polite about it.</p>
<p>Gauge kept looking at me with his brow furrowed. "I don' get it. Your girl friend's got some of the biggest tits I've seen. Figured you'd like this gal."</p>
<p>"You mean Lonna? She's not my girl friend."</p>
<p>Gauge laughed. "You're always together."</p>
<p>"We're both card dealers. We're both whores."</p>
<p>"What the fuck?" He shook his head. "You're always yanking on everyone's chain. Be fuckin' serious for a moment."</p>
<p>I glanced around the table, several of the guys got interested in looking at the other customers or the out the front window.</p>
<p>Rooster spoke up, shaking his head but smiling. "Gauge. You're already way in over your head."</p>
<p>I nodded to Rooster, then turned to Gauge."You and I haven't ever really interacted much. Maybe you didn't notice, I work for Sarah way more than I work for Snake. Lonna and I do the same job."</p>
<p>I took a drink of my water and then leaned into the table. "Tell me this, Gauge. Is there any job that a woman can do better than man?"</p>
<p>He hesitated, then smiled. "Well, yeah. Guys do most jobs better. But—"</p>
<p>"So what about a blow job? Could a man do that better than a woman?"</p>
<p>Rooster, Stitch, and Slim laughed.</p>
<p>Gauge sputtered for a moment, but didn't manage to say anything.</p>
<p>"Consider this. It takes owning a dick to truly deeply understand how to properly suck a dick. Ask Sarah to see the price sheet. I'm a quality product earning a quality price."</p>
<p>Everyone but Gauge laughed now. He actually blushed.</p>
