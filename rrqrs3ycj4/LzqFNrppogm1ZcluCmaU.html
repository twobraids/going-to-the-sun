                  sex involving two genders</p>
 
            </div>
                  
            <p>The blow job became real, not a dream. My eyes flipped open—Lonna’s room. Lying on my back, my head turned toward the bedside clock, the type where the numbers charge like flipping a deck's top card. Every number's a winner.</p>
<p>Lonna was blowing me.</p>
<p>I looked down to see her bobbing her head on my dick. My erection softened, she felt it and switched to a different cadence, long strokes to increase the sensation.</p>
<p>Didn’t work.</p>
<p>She gave up and smiled at me. “Awake, you’re queer. Asleep, I coulda gotten you off.”</p>
<p>"I can't afford you. I better save it for tonight." I yawned and stretched. "It's kinda freaking me out."</p>
<p>She nodded her agreement, but her eyes showed disappointment. "Mountain-man, don't sweat it. You'll be fine. It's just play acting."</p>
<p>"I gotta take a leak." I jumped out of bed and strode into the bathroom, my waning dick damp from her spit.</p>
<p>She called to me as she walked out of the bedroom wearing a bathrobe, "Take a shower. You're cheesy under there, pretty gross."</p>
<p>Back in the bedroom, I dug through my pack, grabbed my own soap and shampoo. Didn't want that perfumed shit she obviously rolled in. A major thing that I didn't get about women, masking a guys scent was like clearcutting a forest or laying suburbia over ancient wetlands—just not right.</p>
<p>Just before I started the shower, she called to me. "You want eggs for breakfast?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>"Tough shit. There's a box of Corn Flakes in the cupboard."</p>
<p>Always pulling my chain.</p>
<p>Took a few minutes to get hot water. The showerhead, a big bulb with an adjustable used-to-be-clear plastic ring around it, had a half dozen settings—never seen one of these things before. I had to play with them all—the hard massage set the pipe in the wall banging—a synchronized jackhammer making the whole trailer shake.</p>
<p>After my shower, I wandered naked into the kitchen while toweling my hair.</p>
<p>She looked up from the table. "Didn't pack a robe?"</p>
<p>"Of course not. No room for a wardrobe on the bike." I chided her. "I'm just doing what Sarah said. We're supposed to act like a couple."</p>
<p>She laughed. "Jesus, you have no idea what normal is."</p>
<p>"I got a pretty good idea. I ran away from that."</p>
<p>She held her eyes on me, then nodded.</p>
