            <p>The blow job became real, not a dream. My eyes flicked open—Lonna’s bedroom. Lying on my back, my head turned toward the bedside clock, the type where the numbers flipped like dealing Blackjack. Every cards's a winner.</p>
<p>Lonna sucked my dick.</p>
<p>I looked down to see her bobbing her head. My erection softened, she felt it and switched to a different cadence, long strokes to increase the sensation.</p>
<p>Didn’t work.</p>
<p>She gave up on me and smiled. “Awake, you’re queer. Asleep, I coulda gotten you off.”</p>
<p>"I can't afford your rates." I yawned and stretched. "I oughta save it for tonight. I'm kinda freaking out about it."</p>
<p>She nodded her agreement. "Mountain-man, don't sweat it. You'll be fine. It's just play acting. No losers in the game."</p>
<p>"I gotta take a leak." I pulled away from her, jumped out of bed and strode into the bathroom. My waning dick, damp from her spit, leaked a few drops of precum.</p>
<p>A fluffy pink bathrobe flashed by the open door.  "Take a shower. You're cheesy under there. Pretty gross."</p>
<p>I called back, "Thought I'm supposed to be a dirty biker."</p>
<p>She shouted back from the kitchen as I walked back into the bedroom. "Angry biker. Nobody said dirty."</p>
<p>I dug through my pack, grabbed my own soap and shampoo. Didn't want that perfumy shit she obviously rolled in. A major thing that I didn't get about women, masking scent was like clearcutting a forest or laying suburbia over ancient wetlands—just not right.</p>
<p>Just before I started the shower, she called to me. "You want eggs for breakfast?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>"Tough shit, ain't got any. There's a box of Corn Flakes in the cupboard."</p>
<p>Always pulling my chain.</p>
<p>Took a few minutes to get hot water. The showerhead, a big bulb with an adjustable used-to-be-clear plastic ring around it, had a half dozen settings—never seen one of these things before. I had to play with them all—the hard massage set the pipe in the wall banging—a harmonic jackhammer making the whole trailer vibrate.</p>
<p>After my shower, I wandered naked into the kitchen while toweling my hair and beard.</p>
<p>She looked up from the table. "Didn't pack a robe?"</p>
<p>"Don't own one. Barely enough room to pack anything on the bike." I chided her. "I'm just doing what Sarah said. Aren’t we supposed to act like a married couple?”</p>
<p>She laughed. "Jesus, you have no idea what normal is. Walkin' around without your pants on is not normal."</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah. Normal isn't high on my list."</p>
<p>She held her eyes on me, then nodded.</p>
<p>I grabbed a bowl off the counter top and set on the table. I filled the bowl with corn flakes. “You got any juice?”</p>
<p>“In the ‘frig. Glasses in the cabinet right of the sink. Milk's on the door.”</p>
<p>I snagged the pitcher of orange juice and poured a half cupful over the corn flakes.</p>
<p>She looked horrified. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“Don’t like milk. Problem?” I sat down. “You done with that?” I reached across the table for the spoon abandoned beside her empty bowl.</p>
<p>“I’ve already used that.”</p>
<p>“With the same mouth that sucked my cheesy dick twenty minutes ago. Not afraid of my own dick.”</p>
<p>“Ewww.”</p>
<p>I shrugged and started eating. "I just wipe it off. I dunno, it's kinda like the mold that makes that French cheese, that soft stuff. I dunno the name of it. Kinda smells like my dick."</p>
<p>Lonna stared at me for a moment before she burst out laughing. "Man Brie!" Both hands rose to cover her mouth as she rocked back and forth, trying to stop laughing.</p>
<p>I grinned and joined her. Such a long time since I'd laughed at silly things like this with a friend—high school?</p>
<p>Took me a while to get back to finishing my cereal.</p>
<p>I set the spoon down, picked up the bowl and drained the leftover orange juice.</p>
<p>"You're really gonna have to help me with this role thing tonight."</p>
<p>“There’s no script, but it follows pretty much the same scene each time. This in the third year in a row the john has bought it.”</p>
<p>“So I’m angry biker husband number three. Who did it last time?”</p>
<p>“Vince did it first. Chris brought a guy from a San Francisco bike club last year. Don’t remember his name.”</p>
<p>“So, on cue, I come in shouting, pin him while he's fucking you, and then shove my dick up his ass."</p>
<p>Simulated rape—David's scarred body shoving my bloody face into the dirt. I shook my head hard trying to dislodge the memory.</p>
<p>Lonna looked hard at me. I blinked on my pokerface.</p>
<p>"Ok, what was that?" Her face changed to concern. "You can't hide from me."</p>
<p>I frowned and feigned irritation. "This is just so ridiculous. How much is he paying for this?"</p>
<p>"No, you're not gettin' off that easy. You're thinkin' about the asshole named David, right?"</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"Ok, that's legit tough." She sighed and put her hand across the table onto mine—only person that ever held my hand like that.</p>
<p>"Listen, I know this john. He complained about Vince and he complained about Lang last year." She stopped, sported a brief grin and nodded. "Yeah, that was his name, Lang. So the john's paying big bucks for a rape scene."</p>
<p>"Do you have to keep saying 'the john'? What's the guy's name?"</p>
<p>"You and I don't get to know that. I'll call him John." She locked eyes with me for a confirmation. "I don't think it's the scene he really wants."</p>
<hr>
<p>It took less than ten minutes from Lonna's trailer to get to Downtown Reno. We rolled up to Harrah's on the Center Street side.</p>
<p>Lonna leaned to her left and our stupid helmets clacked together. "Park in the next block," she said as I made an urgent balance correction due to her lean.</p>
<p>I rolled through the next light, finding a long string of bikes sitting two, sometimes three, bikes to a single car space. No cars at all parking in that block. Judging by the guys loitering on the sidewalk most of these bikes were from a single bike club. I caught a glance of a patch as one guy turned: Ghost River. Didn't know who they were. Didn't think I ought to shove my way into their parking.</p>
<p>"Other side, other side!" Lonna shouted, again banging the front of her helmet into the back of mine.</p>
<p>I felt Lonna's hand leave my side as she pointed to a car pulling out of a parallel space on the other side of the street. The light down the block had changed, so a gap appeared in oncoming traffic.</p>
<p>I took the hard U-turn across the double yellow in the middle of the block. Had to make another balance correction—not used to a passenger. We pulled up to, then rolled backward into the space. I didn't park right in the middle, I favored the end closer to the grill of the car behind the space. Give the guy that has to backup more room, less likely to back into my bike. Besides, two other bikes could pad that space.</p>
<p>As I turned to face the bikes across the street, at least five guys of that Ghost River club had their eyes on me.</p>
<p>Once parked, Lonna hopped off and waited on the sidewalk while I secured the bike. I did as Chris instructed: I turned so the other bikers could see the patch on my back. As I stepped back onto the curb, I put my arm over Lonna. We walked down the block toward the huge casino like the couple we were supposed to be. Didn’t look like the bikers across the street paid any more attention to us.</p>
<p>We bypassed Harrah's main entrance, instead heading into a cafe with its own streetside door. It looked like the place had just dropped in from the 1960s. A long counter dominated the right wall with swivels stools on one side and server alley on the other. The left side, booths filled whole space, all full.</p>
<p>Busy place, several folks waited for tables, the perfect opportunity to feed the conveniently located herd of slot machines.</p>
<p>Looking through to the far end, I could see straight into Harrah's casino floor. Made sense—probably a lot of restaurants directly connected that way. So many people sitting on stools mindlessly pulling the side lever—the proverbial one armed bandit. No wonder Chris and Sarah set up businesses here, they must be harvesting cash.</p>
<p>We waited until an older woman wearing a crisp blue and white waitress uniform smiled at Lonna and gestured to a pair of seats at the counter. "Here you go hon'."</p>
<p>"Hey, mom." They exchanged a brief peck of a kiss.</p>
<p>I squinted at her name tag. Doris walked around to the server side of the counter across from Lonna.</p>
<p>"Mom, this is Karl. The guy I told you was comin' to town."</p>
<p>Doris focused on me, giving me the once over with a skeptical eye.</p>
<p>She turned back to Lonna. "Don't marry 'im."</p>
<p>"Mother!" Lonna's irritation showed. I wasn't sure how real it was.</p>
<p>I laughed, turned to Lonna. “Think it’s too late.”</p>
<p>“Karl!” She repeated the voice she shot at her mother.</p>
<p>Doris handed me a menu, but didn’t give one to Lonna.</p>
<p>Unphased, Doris assumed her professional face and voice to her daughter. “Usual, hon’?”</p>
<p>Didn’t hear Lonna answer and I glanced up to see Doris had turned to me, somehow expecting I would have read the menu and decided in the six seconds.</p>
<p>“BLT” I had’t even seen it on the menu, but all cafes had that. “Fries.”</p>
<p>Doris didn’t write a thing down. She nodded and walked away.</p>
<p>Lonna pulled out a cigarette.</p>
<hr>
<p>From the bitch seat, Lonna navigated us to a faded blue sheet metal warehouse marked only with an address along a street with lined with identical copies. A potted plant sat right of the worn sun bleached windowless door. A yucca, greenish swords with needle tips poking out in all directions, looked more of a puncture hazard than an welcome. A concrete sidewalk spanned the end of the building, but gravel made up the parking area.</p>
<p>I followed behind a tan Honda Civic with a dent in the left rear quarter panel turning into the lot. The bikes parked at the front door took my focus—six of them, four Montana plates and two Nevada plates. I pegged each of the Montana bikes to its rider: Snake, Dolph, Rooster, and Bull.</p>
<p>Just enough space for me to pull next to the Nevada bikes. DId a double take at their engines, a pair of brand new FXR Super Glides with the EVO engine. Not heavy iron anymore, aluminum cylinders. A number of my club brothers had really gotten upset. I didn’t see the problem, but mostly kept my mouth shut about it.</p>
<p>Lonna hopped off while I kicked the stand down.</p>
<p>A guy in a snappy tan blazer, open collar light blue shirt, with blue jeans stuffed into his flashy cowboy boots, strode up from where that Civic had parked. His grin said, grifter, eyes on the marks. He stepped right up, focusing on me, but kept stealing glances at Lonna’s tits.</p>
<p>"Are you Two Braids?" His arm shot out offering a shake. "<i>The</i> Two Braids?"</p>
<p>Warily I answered, "Yeah." I did not extend my hand.</p>
<p>"I'm Don Whitfield, the Marketing Manager." His grin split into a toothy smile.</p>
<p>I just stood there—fought the urge to step back.</p>
<p>Took him a moment to get my meaning and withdraw his hand.</p>
<p>"Off the Record." He nodded as if expecting me to understand.  Like he assured me that I wasn't gonna be quoted in the paper.</p>
<p>Another poker face moment for me.</p>
<p>Lonna stood patiently watching us, maybe slightly amused.</p>
<p>I gestured with my head to walk with me to the door.</p>
<p>He tagged along behind us babbling nonsense. "You really can't judge a book by its cover, can you? Sure wish Sarah had told us you were coming down. You really live on an Indian Reservation?"</p>
<p>I wanted him to shut up.</p>
<p>We stepped into the lobby. There was no receptionist, just a couple couches with a coffee table strewn with magazines. Lonna, stepped ahead of us, speeding up toward a door marked "Ladies." She looked over her shoulder. "You go ahead, I'll catch up"</p>
<p>I stopped, looked around, not sure what direction to go.</p>
<p>Don swung around in front of me. "First time here? I can show you around."</p>
<p>He gestured to the left corridor and stepped in that direction, but stopped with a jerk when I didn’t follow.</p>
<p>"You're the Marketing Manager for Bitterroot Hospitality?"</p>
<p>He paused, but then his smile re-erupted—this guy smiled way too much.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, no, no. That's down there." He pointed to the corridor on the right. "Off the Record. We're down here." He gestured to the left corridor. "Come on, I’ll show you. The guys are gonna love meeting the guy that wrote it."</p>
<p>What the fuck?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0103" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He started down the corridor, beckoning me to follow. I begrudgingly followed feeling a need for some straight answers.</p>
<p>"The programmers are down at the end. Here's where we make the disks." With his open left palm he gestured me into the first room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0105" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked into the tiny room. Two women sat at a pair of IBM ATs. Each had a stack of floppy disks on either side their computers. I watched as one of them popped a floppy out of her machine, stuffed it into a sleeve, and added it to a stack. She pushed in the next floppy, then typed a command at the DOS prompt.</p>
<p>Don reached over to her stack of disks, plucked the one she had just placed there. He held it out to me. "Take it. Congratulations, it's a hit."</p>
<p>I took the disk. The black sticker on the floppy had three white letters in a slanty font making it look fast: "OTR". Beneath that, in red, "Off The Record."</p>
<p>"What is it?" I asked with irritation.</p>
<p>"It's the product. Your product. We're sellin' 'em by the hundreds." That toothy grin came back.</p>
<p>With my back to the doorway, I heard what sounded like somebody running by. Don turned to look, but by the time I turned, there was nothing to see.</p>
<p>"That looked like Chris." He pushed by me and craned his neck down the corridor. Then he stepped out to follow, then shouted down the hall, "Hey, Chris. What's up?"</p>
<p>Chris popped around the corner looking harried. "There you are. I need you down at the conference loom." His eyes dropped to the floppy in my hand.</p>
<p>I raised to my shoulder level and shook it. "What the fuck is this?"</p>
<p>"Not here. Not Now." Then he gave the index finger slicing across the neck signal—the shut it down gesture from the poker table. He reached for the floppy and I pulled it away from his reach.</p>
<p>We locked eyes for a beat. His head jerk toward the lobby ordered me to follow him. I obeyed, but refused to surrender the floppy.</p>
<p>I locked eyes with Don as I walked out with a scowl.</p>
<p>I followed Chris back out to the lobby. Lonna wasn’t there. We continued down the corridor opposite to where Don had led me. We turned into the first open doorway into a conference room with a long table that could seat a dozen.</p>
<p>Chris gestured me to a seat across from where Lonna sat in the last chair at the end of the table’s long side. He sat in the end seat.</p>
<p>I slapped the floppy on the table. “Is this the system that I wrote for Sarah?”</p>
<p>He looked at me with impatience. “I don’t poke my head into Sarah’s business. Don’t know anything about it.” He looked away.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t make sense. Spreading this around makes it less safe. I wrote it for her. If every one knows about it, people can figure out how to break it. You can’t just sell it.”</p>
<p>He frowned at me. “Take it up with her.” He raised both his hands, palms toward me. “Enough. Let’s focus on our own business.”</p>
<p>I glared at him.</p>
<p>“This is your Nevada dealer permit.” Chris dropped a folded paper over the top of the floppy disk—as if blocking it from my sight meant I’d forget about it.</p>
<p>I let out an exasperated sigh and opened the page. My signature sat next to a thumb print on the bottom of the page near the embossed seal from the Nevada Gaming Commission. "Uh, I’ve never given a thumb print to anyone.”</p>
<p>“Don’t sweat it, it’s all taken care of. Nobody’s gonna check it. You’ll be out of the state in forty-eight hours. Keep this on you while you're dealin' tonight.”</p>
<p>“If I don’t need it, why should I keep it?”</p>
<p>He just glanced at me, ignoring my question. He dropped what looked like a ring box in front of each of us, a white box for Lonna and a black box for me.</p>
<p>Lonna snatched it up and opened hers. “Oh, I've always liked this one.”</p>
<p>“These are your wedding rings for tonight,” Chris told me. He looked pleased with himself.</p>
<p>Lonna picked out her ring, a gold band with a circle of oblong pink gems arranged as petals of a flower—kinda gaudy.</p>
<p>“Look’s like a bitterroot,” I said. “Montana state flower.”</p>
<p>“Right,” Chris nodded. “This is Lonna's mark. She's a Bitterroot Bastards woman, under our protection.”</p>
<p>I shook my head. That didn’t make sense. Someone around here would have to recognize that as a bitterroot—it doesn’t grow anywhere near here. Then they’d have to make the link to a bike club from Montana—unlikely.</p>
<p>His look silenced the objection bubbling up in me. Poker face. I shut myself down.</p>
<p>I opened my box: gold band with a deep purple almost black stone. Pretty, I supposed, but didn’t look forward to dealing cards wearing it.</p>
<p>"I don't get it. Why have you had these expensive rings made?"</p>
<p>"We've had 'em for years."</p>
<p>"Costume?"</p>
<p>He shook his head and pointed to Lonna ring. "No. George's wife's wedding ring. She divorced him when he landed in prison. Gave it to Sarah.  Montana sapphires. From that mine between Scalkaho Pass and Philipsburg.”</p>
<p>He pointed at my ring box. “Your’s is just one my old rings. Black garnet. Oughta fit ya’” As if to mollify me, he added, "Montana stone, too."</p>
<p>I had stopped looking at him. Lonna gave me half a smile, I supposed to try to calm me down.</p>
<p>A commotion from the corridor, deep laughter and guys talking.</p>
<p>Rooster walked in looking pissed, but Dolph followed behind him looking amused. “It’s about cooling. Aluminum’ll let them run cooler.”</p>
<p>Bull took up the rear. “They’ll warp like steppin’ on an aluminum can.”</p>
<p>Rooster swung around the end of the table to sit next to Lonna. Dolph stayed on my side.</p>
<p>As he pulled the chair out. “Roost’, wager. Five years, 1990. You’ll be riding an EVO.”</p>
<p>“No fuckin’ way.” Rooster gave two quick shakes of his head.</p>
<p>“Two hundred bucks.” Dolph put his hand across the table, just as Bull sat down next to Rooster.</p>
<p>Rooster looked at Dolph’s hand for a second then grasped it. “Easy money, Dolph, easy money.”</p>
<p>I gave a snort. “How many open bets you guys got between you?”</p>
<p>Just about all of them except Lonna and me laughed.</p>
<p>Rooster answered, “He already owes me.”</p>

<p>"You need to know about the larger picture here. You're part of two related but but separate gigs. There'll be some very wealthy and powerful people here tonight. There's going to be two Bike Clubs, High Desert MC and the Ghost River Clan."</p>
<p>"I saw the Ghost River guys. Bikes parked on the street near Harrah's."</p>
<p>"They see you?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, did as you said and made sure they saw my patch."</p>
<p>Chris nodded.</p>
<p>"The two clubs are negotiating with the money people. Everybody's security people will be on hand. The money got theirs, the hotel, the bike clubs and us."</p>

<hr>
<p>When the meeting ended, I slipped out the door trying to not be noticed. I beelined straight back through the lobby and into the corridor Don called Off The Record. I glanced into that first room where the women still copied disks.</p>
<p>All the way at the end of the hall, I stopped at the doorway of the last room. Four guys sat in the dark facing green CRT screens, all facing away from the doorway. One head turned having seen the light from the doorway shift as my body blocked it.</p>
<p>I reached for the wall switch and flipped the lights on. The fluorescent lights flickered for an instant. Four pasty faces turned around to look at me, squinting and blinking in the light.</p>
<p>The objections came quick. "Hey!" "Turn the lights off." "Who are you?"</p>
<p>I held the floppy disk up. "What the fuck are you doing with my code?"</p>
<p>The guy furthest from the door, about ten years older than me, stood up. "Who are you?" The others leaned away from me, but stayed in their chairs.</p>
<p>"I'm the original author of your code base."</p>
<p>The guy standing it the back. "No, we've written this here." He sounded defiant. "Dave, run and get Don."</p>
<p>The kid named Dave, didn't even look eighteen, stood, made a step toward the door I blocked. He halted, looked back to the guy standing and then back at me.</p>
<p>I stepped aside just a little. In a mocking tone, I said, "Yeah, Dave. Why don't you go get Don?" The kid flinched at me saying his name. Looking to the floor, he fled the room, half bent over in a cringe.</p>
<p>The room had one of the those slap-it-together-yourself freestanding shelves, loaded with books—the same volumes that I used.</p>
<p>"I’ll prove it's my code.  Bring up the code for the file “bsectcpy.asm”, scroll down to the bottom." His eyes widened at the file name, he knew it. Proof enough to me that they had my code.</p>
<p>"I don't know who you are. The code is owned by the company."</p>
<p>I barked out my order. "Open the file. Find the label, all caps, 'MC' and you'll see an ASCIIz string. Decode the hex."</p>
<p>One of the other guys turned to his machine and started typing. "I know that file name. We cut it out."</p>
<p>The first guy turned to him, "Jeff, no. Don't do it." Jeff kept typing.</p>
<p>My jaw dropped. "What do you mean, you cut it out? It copies the disk's original bad sector table into the shadow file system. Without it, it'll just blunder into bad sectors and lose data."</p>
<p>The third guy spoke up. "Wait, could that be the bad disk bug that the guys at Harrah's called about?"</p>
<p>I recounted one of the first failure modes I had detected when I started the project last fall. “Read failures. It’ll try to use sectors the original formatting already marked bad. If you got cheap disks, almost every one will have bad sectors. Every disk will lose data.”</p>
<p>That third guy’s voice got excited. “That describes exactly what they’re seeing. Whole boxes of bad disks.”</p>
<p>Don's voice came from behind me in the hallway. "Sorry Two Braids, I didn't know you were back."</p>
<p>I turned my back to the programmers to face him.</p>
<p>Jeff, interrupted. "I got it. It's a hex string.  I got an ASCII chart. Looks like..." He paused and the read out: "B, I, T, T, E, R, R, ..." He trailed off. "It's the gang name written on his vest."</p>
<p>Don pushed past me into the room. "Guys, this is Two Braids. The guy that wrote the first version of Off The Record. Two Braids, this is John, our head programmer." He gestured to the guy in the back. "That's Jeff, Scott, and, ..." He cut off looking around behind him for someone missing. "Well, that was Dave."</p>
<p>“I didn’t write it to sell.” I frisbee’d the disk at the waste basket. It missed. “Every copy you sell makes it less secure.”</p>
<p>“John’s made some great modifications, streamlined it—“</p>
<p>“Sounds to me like he’s broken it.” I turned back to John. "How much you gettin' paid to wreck my code?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0192" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Don stepped between us, his palms toward John. "Don't answer. We don't talk about individual compensation," he paused, turning back to me, "It's a state law."</p>
<p>I shot back a quick, "Bullshit."</p>
<p>His palms flipped over in mild surrender. “Let's take this in my office.” He gestured for me to step out of the room.</p>
<p>I stomped back into the hallway. Don passed me, then stopped at the next closed door, the one with his name on it. “C’mon in. Can I get you a cup of coffee?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t want a fucking cup of coffee!” We stepped in. Don closed the door behind us.</p>
<p>He walked to his chair behind the desk. In contrast to the furnishings in the programmers' room, Don's desk and side table were solid wood. It all looked expensive. “Sit down, you seem upset. What’s wrong?"</p>
<p>"Upset?" The backs of hands struck the air in front of me. "I didn't know this fucking company even existed until today.” I did not sit down.</p>
<p>His disingenuous smiled looked so at home on his weasel face. “Of course you knew. Sarah’s told me all about you. How could you not know?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “We talked about starting a software company last winter, but she never said she'd already done it."</p>
<p>I shut my eyes for a long breath, willing myself to calm down. "I wrote it to support the club! Part of my prospect work that earned me my place. They never paid me a penny for those all-night sessions."</p>
<p>I failed at holding down my anger. "How much are you paying your programmers? How much have I fucking lost?"</p>
<p>He just gestured with a hands out shrug—that smarmy smile pushed me too far.</p>
<p>The tube of his expensive EGA monitor imploded when it hit the floor—a very satisfying hollow pop, an electrical burn, and acrid smoke.</p>
<p>The door banged open behind me and the voice felt like a cuff to my head. "Two Braids! Stand down!"</p>
<p>I whipped around. Rooster stood in the doorway. Dolph a pace behind him. "You're here for the Club. This is not Club business." He gestured back toward the lobby. "Go."</p>
<p>My face burned with a surge of anger like when turning off a spigot makes the whole plumbing system bang. I obeyed the VP of the Club. I let my shoulders drop and adopted my poker face. It took two paces to step around him and out of Don's office.</p>
<p>Dolph's smirk raised my pressure another notch.</p>
<p>Rooster's voice sounded from behind me giving an order to Don in his office. "Get Sarah on the horn. Let her know he's onto her." He paused. "You oughta unplug that thing."</p>
<p>I charged down into the lobby, before I thought to temper my pace—deep breath.</p>
<p>"Never seen you angry," Dolph said as he caught up with me.</p>
<p>Rooster swept up from behind, "About fucking time. Was startin' to doubt. Told you once you gotta earn respect. Could'a happened a lot sooner, but you did right.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0213" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He shook his head. "Listen, Sarah's jerking you around 'cause you let her. Take it up with her, not that soft suit down the hall. You're a full brother, stake your claim, and take it. Carnie'd back you on this."</p>
<p>Dolph nodded.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0216" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The phone rang, Chris snagged it off the table. "Chris, here."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0217" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Hey, Sarah. Thought I'd hear from you today."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0218" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Well, yeah. He's here."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0219" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I'm not sure that's a good idea right now."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0220" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He pointed at me, then the phone, and tipped his head to make it a question.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0221" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I sat for a moment, then shook my head.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0222" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Uh, no. Does't look like that going to happen." He listened for a moment. "Oh, hell no, you started it, you fix it."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0223" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I heard a loud shout from Sarah's end.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0224" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah, fuck you, too Sarah. So, we're staged for tonight's gig. We'll be on the bikes in a couple hours.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0225" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Yeah, all green lights. We're going for it." Another listening pause.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0226" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Great. I'll give you a report around eleven, tell you how it's going."</p>

<h2 id="Dealing">Dealing</h2>
<p>I could see the pattern. The two guys on the right would fold in the same order one street apart. The High Desert club President would always raise at that point.</p>
<p>I watched for the patterns in how they handled their chips. People often nervously play with their chips. At first glance, if they sent codes to the President, it looked they used different languages. The first guy on the left tended to stroke his stacks, sometimes lifting them and letting them drop back down one at a time quickly like a riffle. The other guy would just lift his stacks, leave a variable number of them behind, and set them back down.</p>
<p>The order they did it stood out. It was a passed signal not a direct signal, two steps long.</p>
<p>I waited for one more confirmation and got it in the next hand.</p>
<p>Just before the fifth street deal, I put my hand over the deck. "Gentlemen, I must pause this game for a ruling."</p>
<p>"Shit." "What the fuck?" Several guys started looking around at each other.</p>
<p>I raised my arm and flipped off Chris.</p>
<p>He noticed and walked over calmly.  As he approached I told him what, who and how entirely with gestured numbers, then I flipped him off again just for good measure.</p>
<p>Chris stepped up to the table. "Gentlemen, we may have an irregularity this table. Please, keep commentary to a minimum and avoid anything that might resemble signaling other players."</p>
<p>He nodded to the table, turned to me. "This hand is live. You may continue."</p>
<p>He stood behind me, to my right watching the table.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, I spotted the pattern again. I signaled Chris and he stepped in after the showdown.  He called for a replacement deck for game integrity.</p>
<p>I pulled the sorted deck and tore the seal. After several quick shuffles and a cut, I started dealing the deck returned to its original order prior to my shuffles.</p>
<p>This time, knowing the cards, the pattern resolved into clarity. I signaled Chris.</p>
<p>"Who's this fucker accusing?" One of the uninvolved Ghost River guys rose up from his seat.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="TheSuite">The Suite</h2>
<hr>
<p>I just started narrowing in on the right rhythm, my thrusts countering his thrusts into Lonna. I forced him into my drumbeat on his ass. Lonna and I locked eyes. Fucking Lonna by proxy, my thrusts up his ass became my thrusts into her with his dick. Holy fuck—stoned—totally in my body, shoving myself up that ladder to ecstasy.</p>
<p>Her tits—I wanted Lonna's tits. I slung one arm over his shoulder and the other around his torso. This forced him upright, where I stepped him back one, pushing his face down to Lonna's pussy.</p>
<p>Lonna knew exactly what to do. She sat up, arms behind to support her, pushing her tits into my face. I sucked them one at a time like a cocksucker working two guys in an alley.</p>
<p>Lonna looked up as the wham of a door opening from the next suite.</p>
<p>"Dust off!" Rooster's command voice. "Two Braids, Lonna. We’re leaving, right now."</p>
<p>Looking back at Rooster over my shoulder, my thrusts stopped deep in the client. I went over the edge as I pulled out. Wearing only my dealer tank top and Bastards cut, I stood there arcing cumloads into the air while trying to focus on where I left my pants.</p>
<p>The room's phone started ringing.</p>
<p>I spotted my pants on the couch, and struggled to get my leaking hardon into my jeans. Lonna was well on her way to being dressed.</p>
<p>The client stood there looking livid. "What is this?"</p>
<p>"You!" Rooster shouted at the guy while pointing at the phone. "Take your goddamn call. My people are out of here.”</p>
<p>I started working on my boots. Lonna stepped up ready to go, looking exactly like having been fucking two minutes earlier—disheveled, wild haired.</p>
<p>As I stood to follow Roosters directions, I saw the growing stain down my left leg from my leaking dick—nothing to do about it.</p>
<p>I followed Lonna through the door. The client, on the phone, made a movement to follow, but Rooster stood him down. He shut and locked the door.</p>
<p>Bull stepped up to me. "Two Braids, gimme your cut." He held his hand out, rubbing his fingers together.</p>
<p>Still stunned, I hesitated, and Bull pulled it down off me. He rolled it up, and I realized they weren't wearing their own cuts anymore.</p>
<p>We headed out another side door and found ourselves in a staff corridor. An elevator ahead had a broom blocking the door from closing.  We piled in, Rooster kicked the broom away.</p>
<p>When the door opened, Dolph stood there. He directed us out a door and directly into a waiting Econoline van. Two staff bartenders and bar servers waited for us.</p>
