            <p><b><span id="U0000" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The blow job became real, not a dream. My eyes flicked open—Lonna’s bedroom. Lying on my back, my head turned toward the bedside clock, the type where the numbers flipped like dealing Blackjack. Every cards's a winner.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Lonna sucked my dick.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked down to see her bobbing her head. My erection softened, she felt it and switched to a different cadence, long strokes to increase the sensation.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Didn’t work.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She gave up on me and smiled. “Awake, you’re queer. Asleep, I coulda gotten you off.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I can't afford your rates." I yawned and stretched. "I oughta save it for tonight. I'm kinda freaking out about it."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She nodded her agreement. "Mountain-man, don't sweat it. You'll be fine. It's just play acting. No losers in the game."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I gotta take a leak." I pulled away from her, jumped out of bed and strode into the bathroom. My waning dick, damp from her spit, leaked a few drops of precum.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A fluffy pink bathrobe flashed by the open door.  "Take a shower. You're cheesy under there. Pretty gross."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I called back, "Thought I'm supposed to be a dirty biker."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She shouted back from the kitchen as I walked back into the bedroom. "Angry biker. Nobody said dirty."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I dug through my pack, grabbed my own soap and shampoo. Didn't want that perfumy shit she obviously rolled in. A major thing that I didn't get about women, masking scent was like clearcutting a forest or laying suburbia over ancient wetlands—just not right.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Just before I started the shower, she called to me. "You want eggs for breakfast?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Sure."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Tough shit, ain't got any. There's a box of Corn Flakes in the cupboard."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Always pulling my chain.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Took a few minutes to get hot water. The showerhead, a big bulb with an adjustable used-to-be-clear plastic ring around it, had a half dozen settings—never seen one of these things before. I had to play with them all—the hard massage set the pipe in the wall banging—a harmonic jackhammer making the whole trailer vibrate.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After my shower, I wandered naked into the kitchen while toweling my hair and beard.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She looked up from the table. "Didn't pack a robe?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Don't own one. Barely enough room to pack anything on the bike." I chided her. "I'm just doing what Sarah said. Aren’t we supposed to act like a married couple?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She laughed. "Jesus, you have no idea what normal is. Walkin' around without your pants on is not normal."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah, yeah. Normal isn't high on my list."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She held her eyes on me, then nodded.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I grabbed a bowl off the counter top and set on the table. I filled the bowl with corn flakes. “You got any juice?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“In the ‘frig. Glasses in the cabinet right of the sink. Milk's on the door.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I snagged the pitcher of orange juice and poured a half cupful over the corn flakes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She looked horrified. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Don’t like milk. Problem?” I sat down. “You done with that?” I reached across the table for the spoon abandoned beside her empty bowl.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“I’ve already used that.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“With the same mouth that sucked my cheesy dick twenty minutes ago. Not afraid of my own dick.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Ewww.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shrugged and started eating. "I just wipe it off. I dunno, it's kinda like the mold that makes that French cheese, that soft stuff. I dunno the name of it. Kinda smells like my dick."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Lonna stared at me for a moment before she burst out laughing. "Man Brie!" Both hands rose to cover her mouth as she rocked back and forth, trying to stop laughing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I grinned and joined her. Such a long time since I'd laughed at silly things like this with a friend—high school?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Took me a while to get back to finishing my cereal.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I set the spoon down, picked up the bowl and drained the leftover orange juice.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You're really gonna have to help me with this role thing tonight."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“There’s no script, but it follows pretty much the same scene each time. This in the third year in a row the john has bought it.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“So I’m angry biker husband number three. Who did it last time?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Vince did it first. Chris brought a guy from a San Francisco bike club last year. Don’t remember his name.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“So, on cue, I come in shouting, pin him while he's fucking you, and then shove my dick up his ass." Simulated rape—David's scarred body shoving my bloody face into the dirt. I shook my head hard trying to dislodge the memory. How the fuck was I going to do this?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Lonna looked hard at me. I slammed on my pokerface.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Ok, what was that?" Her face changed to concern. "You can't hide from me."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I frowned and feigned irritation. "This is ridiculous. How much is he paying for this?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No, you're not gettin' off that easy. You're thinkin' about that ass, David."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I nodded.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“You wouldn’t believe it. From what I know of how you live, you’ll have food, rent, and gas for rent of the year.”</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It took less than ten minutes from Lonna's trailer to get to Downtown Reno. We rolled up to Harrah's on the Center Street side.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0050" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Lonna leaned to her left and our stupid helmets clacked together. "Park in the next block," she said as I made an urgent balance correction due to her lean.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0051" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I rolled through the next light, finding a long string of bikes sitting two, sometimes three, bikes to a single car space. No cars at all parking in that block. Judging by the guys loitering on the sidewalk most of these bikes were from a single bike club. I caught a glance of a patch as one guy turned: Ghost River. Didn't know who they were. Didn't think I ought to shove my way into their parking.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0052" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Other side, other side!" Lonna shouted, again banging the front of her helmet into the back of mine.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I felt Lonna's hand leave my side as she pointed to a car pulling out of a parallel space on the other side of the street. The light down the block had changed, so a gap appeared in oncoming traffic.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0054" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I took the hard U-turn across the double yellow in the middle of the block. Had to make another balance correction—not used to a passenger. We pulled up to, then rolled backward into the space. I didn't park right in the middle, I favored the end closer to the grill of the car behind the space. Give the guy that has to backup more room, less likely to back into my bike. Besides, two other bikes could pad that space.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As I turned to face the bikes across the street, at least five guys of that Ghost River club had their eyes on me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0056" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Once parked, Lonna hopped off and waited on the sidewalk while I secured the bike. I did as Chris instructed: I turned so the other bikers could see the patch on my back. As I stepped back onto the curb, I put my arm over Lonna. We talked down the block toward the huge casino like the couple we were supposed to be.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0057" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We bypassed Harrah's main entrance, instead heading into a cafe with its own streetside door. It looked like the place had just dropped in from the 1960s. A long counter dominated the right wall with swivels stools on one side and server alley on the other. The left side, booths filled whole space, all full.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Busy place, several folks waited for tables, the perfect opportunity to feed the conveniently located herd of slot machines.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0059" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Looking through to the far end, I could see into Harrah's moderatel crowded casino floor. Made sense—probably a lot of restaurants directly connected that way.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0060" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We waited until an older woman wearing a crisp blue and white waitress uniform smiled at Lonna and gestured to a pair of seats at the counter. "Here you go hon'."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0061" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Hey, mom." They exchanged a brief peck of a kiss.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0062" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I squinted at her name tag. Doris walked around to the server side of the counter across from Lonna.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0063" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Mom, this is Karl. The guy I told you was comin' to town."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0064" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Doris focused on me, giving me the once over with a skeptical eye.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0065" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She turned back to Lonna. "Don't marry 'im."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0066" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Mother." Lonna's irritation showed. I wasn't sure how real it was.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0067" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Doris handed me a menu, but didn’t give one to Lonna. “Usual, hon’?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0068" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Didn’t hear Lonna answer and I glanced up to see Doris had turned to me, somehow expecting I would have read the menu and decided in the six seconds it had been in my hand. “BLT” I had’t even seen it on the menu, but all cafes were the same. “Fries.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0069" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Doris didn’t write a thing down. She nodded and walked away.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0070" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Lonna pulled out a cigarette.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0072" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris, Lonna and I sat at one end of a conference table, Chris at the end</p>
<p><b><span id="U0073" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“This is your Nevada dealer permit.” Chris handed me a folded paper.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0074" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I opened it—my thumb print on the bottom of the page near the embossed seal from the Nevada Gaming Commission. "Uh, I’ve never given a thumb print to anyone.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0075" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Don’t sweat it, it’s all taken care of. Nobody’s gonna check it. You’ll be out of the state in forty-eight hours. Keep this on you while you're dealin' tonight.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0076" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He dropped a what looked like a ring box in front of each of us, a white box for Lonna and a black box for me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0077" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Lonna opened hers. “Oh, I've always liked this one.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0078" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“These are your wedding rings for tonight,” Chris told me. He looked pleased with himself.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0079" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Lonna picked out her ring, a gold band with a circle of oblong pink gems arranged as petals of a flower—kinda gaudy.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0080" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Look’s like a bitterroot, to me,” I said. “The Montana state flower.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0081" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“You’re right,” Chris nodded. “This is Lonna's mark. She's a Bitterroot Bastards woman, under our protection.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0082" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>That didn’t make sense to me. Someone around here would have to recognize that as a bitterroot then make the link to a bike club from Montana—kinda unlikely. I let it go, didn’t really need to know.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0083" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I opened my box: gold band with a deep purple almost black stone. Pretty, I supposed, but didn’t look forward to dealing cards wearing it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0084" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I don't get it. Why have you  had these expensive rings made?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0085" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"We've had 'em for years."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0086" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"So it's just costume jewelry?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0087" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No. Lonna's ring was George's wife's wedding ring. She divorced him when he went to prison. She just gave it to Sarah. They’re pink Montana sapphires. A jeweler in Butte make the ring.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0088" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Your’s is just one my old rings. It’s a black garnet.”</p>

<p><b><span id="U0091" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"We're a hospitality service provider, we provide staffing for private clients for their functions on rented hotel properties. We have a cooperative arrangement the big hotels, we provide the staff, they provide the food, the booze and the space."</p>

<p><b><span id="U0096" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris nodded.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0097" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"The two clubs are negotiating with the money people. Everybody's security people will be on hand. The money got theirs, the hotel, the bike clubs and us."</p>

<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0100" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The door opened. Rooster, Bull and Dolph walked in. I didn't even know they were here in Reno.  Dolph walked around the end of the table and sat next to me, while Bull and Rooster took the side with Lonna.</p>
<hr>
<p>I just started narrowing in on the right rhythm, my thrusts countering his thrusts into Lonna. I forced him into my drumbeat on his ass. Lonna and I locked eyes. Fucking Lonna by proxy, my thrusts up his ass became my thrusts into her with his dick. Holy fuck—stoned—totally in my body, shoving myself up that ladder to ecstasy.</p>
<p>Her tits—I wanted Lonna's tits. I slung one arm over his shoulder and the other around his torso. This forced him upright, where I stepped him back one, pushing his face down to Lonna's pussy.</p>
<p>Lonna knew exactly what to do. She sat up, arms behind to support her, pushing her tits into my face. I sucked them one at a time like a cocksucker working two guys in an alley.</p>
<p>Lonna looked up as the wham of a door opening from the next suite.</p>
<p>"Dust off!" Rooster's command voice. "Two Braids, Lonna. Now."</p>
<p>My head over my shoulder looking back at him, my thrusts stopped deep in him. I went over the edge as I pulled out. Wearing only my dealer tank top and Bastards cut, I stood there arcing cumloads into the air while trying to focus on where I left my pants.</p>
<p>The room's phone started ringing.</p>
<p>I spotted my pants on the couch, and struggled to get my leaking hardon into my jeans. Lonna was well on her way to being dressed.</p>
<p>The client stood there looking livid. "What is this?"</p>
<p>"You!" Rooster shouted at the guy. "Take your call." He pointed at the phone. "My people are out."</p>
<p>I started working on my boots. Lonna stepped up ready to go, looking exactly like having been fucking two minutes earlier—disheveled, wild haired.</p>
<p>As I stood to follow Roosters directions, I saw the growing stain down my left leg from my leaking dick—nothing to do about it.</p>
<p>I followed Lonna through the door. The client, on the phone, made a movement to follow, but Rooster stood him down. He shut and locked the door.</p>
<p>Bull stepped up to me. "Two Braids, gimme your cut." He held his hand out, rubbing his fingers together.</p>
<p>Still stunned, I hesitated, and Bull pulled it down off me. He rolled it up, and I realized they weren't wearing their own cuts anymore.</p>
<p>We headed out another side door and found ourselves in a staff corridor. An elevator ahead had a broom blocking the door from closing.  We piled in, Rooster kicked the broom away.</p>
<p>When the door opened, Dolph stood there. He directed us out a door and directly into a waiting Econoline van. Two staff bartenders and bar servers waited for us.</p>
