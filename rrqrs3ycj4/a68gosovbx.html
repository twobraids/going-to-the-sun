<p>"Sarah, I know you keep the paper records of your, uh, girls and me up at the house. I see you've put them on the hard drive. Anyone could get access to them on the computer."</p>
<p>She kept her deadpan face.</p>
<p>I shook my head. "Ok, I'll back off. Just know, if they are what I think they are, you need to keep them off the computer's hard drive. Put them on floppies so you can secure them."</p>
<p>Her heavy sigh surprised me.</p>
<p>"I'm trying to not have to rely on the safe."</p>
<p>"I don't know any tools on PCs that will encrpyt your files, but its possible."</p>
<p>"Encrypt?"</p>
<p>"Turn it into a secret code that only you can unlock."</p>
<p>"You can do that?"</p>
<p>I thought for a few moments, "...yes. There's a couple ways it could be done. I'd have to study it." I froze in deep thought, falling down the structure of the problem. "There's two parts, hiding and obfuscating. Seems like two separate things."</p>
<p>Pulled myself self out my mind—back with Sarah. "Hiding is just keeping something out of sight, like your safe. Obfuscating is making sure only you can read it once its out of the safe. It's a cypher, a secret code."</p>
<p>I frowned. "You'd have to decipher it so that Peachtree could read it."  I looked up to the ceiling, falling silent again. "Yeah, then you'd have to re-cypher it. Suspicious to have an unreadable file on a hard drive. A floppy, though. Pretends to be  defective..."</p>
<p>"Jesus, Karl. I grew up in a carnival and you're one of the weirdest people I ever met."</p>
<p>"I gonna have to study. I got a new book back at my cabin, 'MS-DOS Programmer’s Reference'.  I'll be back on Friday."</p>
<h2 id="1984-08-10-TheIronHorse">1984-08-10 - The Iron Horse</h2>
<p>"I can do it." I dropped a paper diagram on Sarah's desk."</p>
<p>She looked up at me in confusion. "...uh, what's this?"</p>
<p>"It's a design to make the data on your PeachTree data disk only readable by you. You use another floppy disk as a key first. If you don't use the key disk, the computer'll think its a bad disk. It can't read it. When you do use the key, you can read the data fine until you reboot or turn the computer off."</p>
<p>"You can make do that?" She looked skeptical.</p>
<p>I dropped the sheaf of paper on top of the design, forty pages of hand written C and Assembly code in the tiniest print I could write. "I think it'll work. I just need to try it. I need a compiler, an editor, and the time to type this in. to work on it."</p>
<p>"How does it work?"</p>
<p>I smiled, excited to reveal the secret. "The key is hooking the INT13 interrupt. I can make the floppy drive do whatever I want. It it's a TSR, Terminate and Stay Resident. Peachtree wont't even know its writing to the disk in a crazy way."</p>
<p>She started paging through the sheets of paper. Looking closely at the code on several pages, before looking back at me. "I don't get it. What is this?"</p>
<p>"It's all the C and assembler code to make an executable file. I've studied how to write software for MS-DOS. I know I can make it work. I just need to get my hands on a computer."</p>
<p>"Can't you guys around computers ever talk English?" She looked both confused and concerned. "How much will it cost to get what you need?"</p>
<p>"I need the Lattice C compiler and access to one of these computers for a few days. I can order it. There's an ad in the back of Dr. Dobbs. Uh, its a magazine about computers. The compiler cost about $300 plus shipping. I'm gonna need a couple boxes of high density floppies."</p>
