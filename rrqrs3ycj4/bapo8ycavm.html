            <p>I woke up several times during the night. First couple times—delirious? Couldn't tell where I was, the room seemed huge, but wrapped too tightly around me. Confused. Urgent need to run—get away. It was all my fault—I killed them. I think once I shouted out. I remember a face leering over me and a wash of fear—likely Maggie, just being a nurse.</p>
<p>Dawn now—I remember all of it. I gotta go—got keep running—I've wrecked everything, can't let it spread here. My leathers hung over the chair across the room. I could just sneak out—leave these good people in peace. Shouldn't have come here.</p>
<p>My head throbbed as I pulled myself out of bed. I reached up and felt the huge bandage on the side of my head. I imagined trying to keep it in place in the wind of the highway. No solution for that came to me.</p>
<p>I dressed as quickly as I could—goddamn, my head hurt.</p>
<hr>
<p>I poked my head out the bedroom into the hallway and looked both directions. I could see the kitchen lights from down the hall—my only exit. Okay—no sneaking—if Ted's there, I’ll just thank him and go. I stepped out and headed down the hallway.</p>
<p>Emerging into the light, I saw Ted at the dinette table, waiting for me—grave—intent.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Karl.” He paused for my response.</p>
<p>I struggled with what to say, feeling flustered and slow. Nothing came out.</p>
<p>“Here's the deal, Karl. I'm not going to stop you if you leave right now. You’re free to go. But in about two hours, I'm gonna call the sheriff."</p>
<p>I stood there at the end of the table, wearing the riding leathers he had given me—got to ride out of here. Where? Is my cabin a safe place to go? I looked to the doorway to the garage, and heaved a deep sigh. Goddamn, but my head hurt.</p>
<p>"Maggie says you still need medical help. She can provide it. I want you stay here and explain this. There's a big chunk of this story I don't know.  I need to figure out what I need to do next. You either need protection or you need arresting.” He reached up and rubbed his forehead. “That's two different phone calls. What you say will tell me which call I make.”</p>
<p>I pulled the closest chair out from the table. I sat down, shut my eyes. When I reopened them a moment later, they took way too long to refocus on Ted. Couldn’t I ride if I tried.</p>
<p>"Karl, where is David?"</p>
<p>That startled me, not what I expected. I sat with it for a moment, grasping for the connection. “What does David have to do with this?”</p>
<p>Ted frowned. “David disappeared last fall. We were supposed have a hunting trip at his place in October. The cabin was ransacked, almost everything gone.”</p>
<p>"Saw him in September, maybe. Last time I was at his cabin, he was movin' out. Said your hunting trip had been cancelled.” I thought for a moment, he had said something odd, a term I didn’t understand. I couldn’t remember it.</p>
<p>"Why are you on his bike?”</p>
<p>"Not his bike. I bought it at the Glacier County sheriff's auction last November. I got the registration here in my jacket."</p>
<p>"Show me."</p>
<p>I reached into left breast pocket of my jacket—pulled out a torn smashed spiral bound notepad. I let out a little involuntary “oh” as I set it on the table—no time look at it.</p>
<p>I found my wallet, ruffled through some bills until I found the heavily folded registration paper.</p>
<p>I handed it to Ted.</p>
<p>Show you papers—how would David the sovereign citizen have reacted to this?</p>
<p>He wrote the VIN on a paper scrap. "I’m gonna verify this... Not surprised the state seized his bike, that no tax sovereign bullshit. What does surprise me is you happen to be the one ended up buyin’ it."</p>
<p>He fell silent for a moment of thinking. “How’d you even find out about the sale? You knew it was going to happen?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “I didn’t want it.” I clenched my teeth to stop myself.</p>
<p>“Son, that doesn't make much sense. You want to try again?”</p>
<p>I almost vomited the words, “They said it was justice. Said David owed it to me.”</p>
<p>"Who said that?"</p>
<p>“David got into trouble with the Bastards. He beat up two prostitutes under their protection. That night we played poker at the Horse… he took Linda back to the motel. Beat her up bad. He ran. That's why he wasn’t there when you woke up."</p>
<p>Ted looked shocked, but then gritted his teeth. “He did that to his ex-wife, too. Jesus, what’s wrong with him?”</p>
<p>“Last year, a week after your backyard barbecue where everybody freaked out about me..." I took a deep breath and confessed. "...David beat the crap out of me.”</p>
<p>“Wait, you said...” He took his own deep breath. "...two ...hookers. Who was the other one?"</p>
<p>I didn't answer.</p>
<p>It took Ted a moment to chew on it. His jaw set tight, a moment of grinding teeth. Under the table light, the lines of his face darkened.  I could read the deduction working through his head, stepping through a program. He looked down, shook his head once, then fixed me with a hard stare. His nostrils flared. "The MC. You let them do this to you?"</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ, Ted." My hands pounded the air in front of me in time with the throbbing pain. "You've got this the wrong way around."</p>
<p>Shaking my head, I explained, "David started paying me weeks before I even knew the Bastards existed. I needed the money. They didn't push me into it, David did." Not a lie.</p>
<p>"When I put on the Club's cut, Carnie made my safety his business." Also not a lie.</p>
<p>Ted pursed his lips, not letting go of his anger. "What did they do to David? Where is he?"</p>
<p>"Prison, Deer Lodge?"</p>
<p>"Answer the question. What did the club do?"</p>
<p>"You know how David drinks. The Club gave him the opportunity to get drunk. Sarah just called the Sheriff." Omission—a lie?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“The Club gave me real work, not just the card dealing. I setup, maintain, and program the accounting computers at the bar and the club. Now Sarah started a computer consulting business with my code. It's a dream I never thought I could ever have!" My shouting surprised me.</p>
<p>"I don't know where she is. Her house with Carnie and Snake burned. I can't find anybody. I don't know what to do." The tears came and dropped my eyes onto Dolph’s notepad. I picked it up, separated two pages. Rooster's judging gaze stared at me—you don't talk club business with outsiders.</p>
<p>"And you're not concerned that somebody shot you yesterday?"</p>
<p>I shook my head. "No, I'm not. He's protecting his kids. Bet he's as scared as I am. It’s not his fault, he didn’t mean to."</p>
<p>Like an apparition, David's scarred body appeared in my mind—not his fault. His fist flying toward my face—he didn't mean to.</p>
<p>Ted shook his head. “Son, you know you’re going have to talk to the police.”</p>
<p>"David. The cops. None of this has anything to with my problem. I need to find out what happened. I got thrown out of my real family, the MC is my family now. I'm afraid that people I love are injured or dead. I gotta find out where they are. Last night, you said there’s a newspaper. Do you still have it?"</p>
<p>Maggie strode in from the living room. She had heard it all. “Ted, just give him the paper.” She proceeded in to the kitchen, pulling china and cookware out to prepare breakfast.</p>
<p>I looked to Ted eagerly. "You got the paper?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0052" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He rose from the table in silence, stepped to the counter separating the dinette from the rest of the kitchen. He pulled two sheets and brought them to me.</p>
<p>I snatched them and sat back down with them. I scanned the front page of the Great Falls Tribune from two days after the fire. I went through the article just looking for names. Nothing.</p>
<p>I switched to the page from days later. There it was, “Vince Mystic”. I already knew it. I already knew it. I already fucking knew it.</p>
<p>Lonna, Chris, Sarah and Dolph were not on the list, but the list was otherwise useless to me. I knew my brothers by their club names, not their given names. Six guys named under Vince's and I didn't know who they were.</p>
<p>I skipped back to top of the article and learned of Vince’s heroism that night. He kept going back in to save people. The last time, he decked a firefighter that tried to stop him. He didn't come back out.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes, bowed my head. Just sat there in silence listening to the clink of dishes and sizzle of bacon in a pan.</p>
<p>Couldn't been more than a few minutes, Maggie put a plate in front of me. I thanked her and poked at the food, but ate very little.</p>
<p>After they finished eating, Maggie escorted me to the guest room, got me out of my riding leathers and back into the bed. The pill she gave me put me to sleep quickly but did not stop the dreams.</p>
<p>I killed them all. All my fault.</p>
<hr>
<p>Maggie woke me from my drug induced stupor for a change of bandages. She nodded at her own first-aide handy-work. She cleaned my wound with a gentle steady hand, applied a new bandage. By the time she finished, my need for the bathroom forced me out of bed.</p>
<p>After relieving myself, my stomach growled loud enough for Maggie to hear it.</p>
<p>"C'mon. Let's get you some lunch." She tried to lead me down the hallway as if were crippled. I pulled my arm away to walk myself into the kitchen.</p>
<p>I stepped into the kitchen with her with the intent of participating in the preparation of my lunch.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0066" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Get out of my kitchen." She pointed at the dinette. "Sit."</p>
<p>Couldn't defy the order. I pulled up a chair by the far wall and sat facing her.</p>
<p>The big square window displayed the front yard in full afternoon sun. Ted pushed a lawn mower across the drying mid-season grass , sweat soaking a line the down the front of his white t-shirt.</p>
<p>Maggie handed me a plate and sandwich—some sort of ambiguous pink lunch meat on white bread with lettuce and too much mayonnaise. I gratefully took it and started eating.</p>
<p>Ted came inside before I was halfway through my meal. He sat down across the table from me with a beer.</p>
<p>It took me a while for me to look up from my plate. "Did you call the Sheriff?"</p>
<p>Ted looked at me for a beat before stating, "No."</p>
<p>"What was the other call?"</p>
<p>Again, it took him a moment to answer. "Coyote."</p>
<p>I sat for a moment chewing on that name trying to place it. I kept twisting it to be a name of someone on the Rez—some friend of Tom's?</p>
<p>I had taken another two bites of my sandwich before the name clicked.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0077" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>" The Foresters. The Sargent of Arms. I dealt for him on New Years Eve." I tipped my head and asked, "How do you know him?"</p>
<p>His voice, as matter of fact as if were testifying in court, he said, "I was Road Captain in the summers of '78 and '79."</p>
<p>My jaw dropped. "You're a Forester?"</p>
<p>He nodded. "One of the founding members of the Missoula chapter in '77.  I'm No-Nox."</p>
<p>"No-Nox." Again I struggled to figure out why the name sounded familiar. "What does it mean?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0082" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He sighed. “I didn’t choose it. It’s the leaded gas formulation from Gulf. Hell, my stations are all Texaco.”</p>
<hr>
<p>"What happened to Deadhead? Did they kill him?" My voice cracked with the desperation of the question.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0085" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"The Bastards certainly tried. Stripping a man of his coat then shoving him out the door when it's below zero was cruel."</p>
<p>"What happened?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0087" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Don't know exactly. He got some frostbite. The Brothers eventually located him, got him to the hospital."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0088" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I nodded, keeping my feeling of relief to myself.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0089" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"The Foresters aren't like the Bastards, Karl. We handled it in a civilized manner. He lied to us. Stripped him of the patch. He skipped town."</p>
