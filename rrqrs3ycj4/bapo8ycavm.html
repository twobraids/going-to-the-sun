            <p>I woke up several times during the night—first couple times—delirious—couldn't tell where I was, maybe not even who I was. Just felt the compulsion to run—get away. I think once I shouted out. I remember a face leering over me and a wash of fear—likely Maggie, just being a nurse.</p>
<p>Dawn now—I remember all of it. I gotta go—got keep running—I've wrecked everything, can't let it spread here. My leathers hung over the chair across the room. I could just sneak out—leave these good people in peace. Shouldn't have come here.</p>
<p>My head throbbed as I pulled myself out of bed. I reached up and felt the huge bandage on the side of my head. I imagined trying to keep it in place in the wind of the highway. No solution for that came to me.</p>
<p>I dressed as quickly as I could, fighting that headache.</p>
<hr>
<p>I poked my head out the bedroom into the hallway and looked both directions. I could see the kitchen lights from down the hall—my only exit. Okay—no sneaking—if Ted's there, I’ll just thank him and go. I stepped out and headed down the hallway.</p>
<p>Emerging into the light, I saw Ted at the dinette table, waiting for me—grave, intent.</p>
<p>"Good morning, Karl.” He paused for my response.</p>
<p>I struggled with what to say, feeling flustered and slow. Nothing came out.</p>
<p>“Here's the deal, Karl. I'm not going to stop you if you leave right now. You’re free to go. But in about two hours, I'm gonna call the sheriff."</p>
<p>I stood there at the end of the table, wearing the riding leathers he had given me—determined to ride out. To where? Is my cabin a safe place to go? I looked to the doorway to the garage, and heaved a deep sigh. Goddamn, but my head hurt.</p>
<p>"Maggie says you still need medical help. She can provide it. I want you stay here and explain this. There's a big chunk of this story I don't know.  I need to figure out what I need to do next. You either need protection or you need arresting.” He reached up and rubbed his forehead. “That's two different phone calls. What you say will tell me which call I make.”</p>
<p>I pulled the closest chair out from the table. I sat down, shut my eyes. When I reopened them a moment later, they took way too long to refocus on Ted. Couldn’t I ride if I tried.</p>
<p>"Karl, where is David?"</p>
<p>That startled me, not what I expected. I sat with it for a moment, grasping for the connection. “What does David have to do with this?”</p>
<p>Ted frowned. “David disappeared last fall. We were supposed have a hunting trip at his place in October. The cabin was ransacked, almost everything gone.”</p>
<p>"Saw him in September, maybe. Last time I was at his cabin, he was movin' out. Said your hunting trip had been cancelled.” I thought for a moment, he had said something odd, a term I didn’t understand. I couldn’t remember it.</p>
<p>"Why are you on his bike?”</p>
<p>"Not his bike anymore. I bought it at the Glacier County sheriff's auction last November. I got the registration here in my jacket."</p>
<p>"Show me."</p>
<p>I pulled my wallet out of the left breast pocket of my jacket. Flipped it open, ruffled through some bills until I found the heavily folded registration document.</p>
<p>Show you papers—how would David the sovereign citizen have reacted to this?</p>
<p>He wrote the VIN on a notepad. "I’m gonna verify this... Not surprised the state seized his bike, that no tax sovereign bullshit. What does surprise me is you happen to be the one ended up buyin’ it." He fell silent for a moment of thinking.</p>
<p>“How’d you even find out about the sale? You knew it was going to happen?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “I didn’t want it.” I clenched my teeth to stop myself.</p>
<p>“Son, that doesn't make much sense. You want to try again?”</p>
<p>"David has nothing to do with the problem here. I need to find out what happened. I got thrown out of my real family, the MC is my family now. I'm afraid that people I love are injured or dead. I gotta find out where they are."</p>
<hr>
<p>_TODO ALTERNATIVE_ - wrong direction</p>
<p>I almost vomited the words, “They said it was justice. Said David owed it to me.”</p>
<p>"Who said that?"</p>
<p>“David got into trouble with the Bastards. He beat up two prostitutes under their protection. That night we played poker at the Horse… he took Linda back to the motel. Beat up her bad. He ran. That's why he wasn’t there when you woke up."</p>
<p>Ted looked shocked, but then gritted his teeth. “He did that to his ex-wife, too. Jesus, what’s wrong with him?”</p>
<p>“Last year, a week after your backyard barbecue where everybody freaked out about me—David beat the crap out of me.”</p>
<p>“Wait, you said...” He took a breath. "...two ...hookers?"</p>
<p>“Yep.”</p>
<p>It took Ted a moment to chew on that.  _TODO--> anger reaction_</p>
<p>"Ted, no. No, that's not it." I gestured wildly with my hands to interrupt him putting all the pieces together the wrong way around. "David started paying me weeks before I even knew about the Bastards. They didn't push me into it, David did." Not a lie. "They offered protection." Also not a lie. "They provided the offramp." That was the lie.</p>
