            <h2 id="RailroadCreekRanch">Railroad Creek Ranch</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned the key. The Subaru answered with a thin, useless whine.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The engine shop teacher at the tribal vocational college had explained it. Last month, he rescued me from the parking lot after the faculty meeting.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I let the key go. The whining died with a chirp.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He had shown me the spot on the starter to tap with a box wrench. It was supposed to free up some stuck part. I didn't really listen to him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Only wanted the steps that got the problem out of my face without bleeding cash.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Six taps. Six turns of the key. No joy.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I had a class to teach. Paycheck only tracks hours facing students. Can't lose a day's pay.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Slamming the door, I jumped out to eye my mountain bike leaning on the woodshed. Might work.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Trotted on to the cabin to check the clock.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>One hour and eleven minutes against twenty miles on a bike geared for trails and logging roads.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I traced the US2 route in my head, calculating the time, taking wind and the hills into account. Not feasible.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Serious trouble now.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Gladys, my landlady, had that old Buick. The restaurant was open, she wouldn't need it. I blew out a sigh. Gonna be a hard sell. No other options.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I slung my daypack over my shoulder and bolted for the door. Yanked on the knob as I ran by. Wrong sound behind me. I twisted mid-stride to glance back. Didn't latch, bounced open.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Goddamn it, everything around me is shit.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I leapt back onto the deck, lifted hard on the doorknob to get a solid click from the latch.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My little A-frame cabin relied on slap-together construction from the sixties. No proper foundation, just stacks of rotting 4x4s. The floors sagged. The front wall torqued to the left, twisting the doorframe out of square. Slow motion structural failure. A matter of time.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Boots back on the gravel, I dashed between the Subaru and the woodshed. I ducked down the trail, weaving between the trees, leaping over the deadfall.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Fucking car.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The roar of the creek came first. The trail curved into the gully, the smell hung in still air: organic rot, metallic tang. Early May snowmelt turned my usual creek crossing into a churning whitewater deathtrap. Too wide. Too dangerous to jump.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Can't have delays.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I veered into the undergrowth. Crashed through the bramble, twenty yards downstream. The fallen ponderosa pine snag from last summer’s storm still spanned the banks.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>With vertical branch as handhold, I pulled myself up onto the trunk. Arms out for balance. Eyes to the far side. Feet take care of themselves. Careful. Rushing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>On the other side, I leapt down into the brush, snagging my jacket on a branch. The brittle wood broke well before the denim would have ripped. No time to rejoin my trail. Push through. Snowberry, serviceberry, dogwood branches clawed at me as I forced my way downhill.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I burst into the open: the cluster of tourist cabins of Railroad Creek Ranch at the base of the mountain wall that defined Glacier National Park's southern boundary. I ran between the two closest buildings, around the parked cars, and over to Gladys's restaurant, another hundred yards east.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I sprinted up the steps and pushed through the door into the dining room. The little bell on the doorframe announced my entry.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Ruth, at the cash register, looked up from her romance novel, putting on her tourist welcome smile. Her long black braids and earrings beaded with feathers identified her as a young woman of the Blackfeet tribe, the face that Gladys put up front for the tourists.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The staged smile vanished when she saw me. "Hey, Karl. You wanna table?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My eyes always snagged on that cross hanging from her necklace. "No. Is Gladys in the kitchen?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah. New cook didn't show up again." She looked back down to her book.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I walked, not daring to run, through the dining room: smell of the deep fryer and grilled beef. Only two tables occupied. I pushed through the swinging kitchen door.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Gladys stood at the grill cooking burgers. She scowled at me from under a stiff piled hairstyle of a different era. She didn't greet me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Not gonna work.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Gladys, I need a favor. I'm teaching a class in an hour, and I can't get my car started." I bowed my head, a nod of supplication. "Can I borrow your car?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Her scowl deepened. I braced for the familiar tirade.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"That school’s a goddamn waste of money. Just another scam like that  factory makin' Blackfeet pencils. Heard they're folding " Right on schedule.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pursed my lips and tried again. "I know you don’t like it. It's my job to teach there. I need to get going. Please?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She fixed me with her skeptical but tired eyes. "Go hitchhike."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shook my head. Hell. "Who would stop for me?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She looked up from the grill with her old-lady scowl. So like my mother. "Take Bob's bike. The key's on the rack in the office."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I froze. "Um, I don't know how to ride a motorcycle."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Well, guess you're not teachin', are ya'?" She turned away to flip the burgers. I was dismissed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I'd get no more help from her.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The stubby bike key hung at the end of the rack in the office. I stood staring at it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Gladys's scowl, just like my mother's. She stood behind my Dad. His raised voice beating me down. "As a homosexual, you're just another criminal. A crook."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>In his cold courtroom lawyer voice, he passed my sentence. "You have no right to own a home. You have no right to have a job. You have two hours to gather what you want to keep, then you're out."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>That same sort of panicked rush all over again. Two hours then. Less than one now.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0048" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I didn't resist it. I used it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Grabbed the key, just like I yanked the Subaru key off the rack back home on that day my life fell apart.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0050" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pushed through the screen door. It thwacked closed behind me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0051" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My father banished me. The State of Montana condemned me to prison. The Bible sentenced me to death.  Screwed no matter what I do. Stacked deck. Rigged game.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0052" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My life just didn't matter.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stomped over to the bike sitting in the open wood shed not five yards away. Still a whole cord of wood left over from winter. I chopped every piece to cover my rent.</p>
<p>Bob's bike, a Honda CX500 Deluxe with a maroon tank, sat abandoned, covered with dust and pine needles.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Bob was Gladys's younger son, about the same age as me. We never got along. He spent his days shooting up cans with his rifle out behind the restaurant. He and his old Toyota truck vanished last Fall. Never knew where he went, never really cared. I got to take over his chores for Gladys. Made the rent affordable.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0056" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The pine needles brushed easily off the seat and the tank. Webs on the handlebars snagged, stretched, let go with my sweeping fingers. No thorough cleaning.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0057" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I traced out cables and tubes. My stomach rolled; the brakes were backwards. On the motorcycle, the right handgrip pulled the front brake. Bicycles put the rear brake there. An instinctual move in a crisis meant flipping a motorcycle over the front wheel. I shook my head.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The left hand lever engaged the clutch. I clicked the toe shifter several times on the left side above the foot peg, feeling the mechanical notch of each gear. Just a straight line like a musical scale. Neutral, a weird half step up from the bottom, but not moving down.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0059" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>No more research. Gotta get going.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0060" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I jammed the key into the slot below the speedometer and twisted it to “On.” The indicator light lit. Battery still got power.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0061" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pulled the clutch, thumbed the “Start” button.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0063" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>On/off rocker next to the start button. Both key and on/off. Didn't expect that.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0064" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I clicked it to on and hit the starter. The engine chugged a couple times. Didn't catch. No whine like the Subaru.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0065" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Followed the cable from behind the air filter to the choke lever at my left thumb. I feathered it open in conjunction with the start button. It caught, sputtered, coughed. Blue exhaust. Burned oil smell. Backing off the choke evened out the idle. Once steady, I rolled the throttle. When I let go, the backfire cracked like a gunshot behind me. Bob's rifle. On his bike.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0066" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Clutch in. Foot down on the shifter. A solid clunk. First gear.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0067" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I rolled on the throttle and released the clutch like the Subaru's.  The bike lurched forward four feet, snapped my head back hard. Engine died hard, too.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0068" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>No time for hesitation. The starter sounded again. Engine caught. Let the clutch out even slower, feathering it, easing the throttle. The bike crawled forward. Kept my boots walking along the ground until the momentum took over the balance. Lifted them onto the pegs as I crawled the through the restaurant parking.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0069" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Speed crept up. The engine whined. Second gear.  Another clunk from the transmission. Clutch out, roll throttle. First time in my life riding a motorcycle. Not bad. Fifteen miles per hour. Half a mile to the stop sign at the highway.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0070" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The road curved gently toward the stop sign. I let off the throttle to slow down. The gravel got deeper. Wobbled. Every muscle tightened. I did not mean to roll the throttle.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0071" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The rear tire spun, spraying gravel. The bike fish-tailed, cleared the gravel down to the hardpack, and launched forward onto the highway.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0072" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>No chance to check for traffic.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0073" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I crossed the fog line, aimed straight across the lanes. Straight for the embankment of the raging Railroad Creek. I threw my weight left, ready to skid the rear tire, hoping to swing the bike around and line up with the road instead of launching off it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0074" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Mountain bike instincts.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0075" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>With my lean, I yanked the right hand-lever hard. Not a mountain bike. Front tire locked.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0076" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My left shoulder hit the asphalt hard, taking the brunt of the impact from my head. Nobody rides with a helmet in Montana. The bike crashed down beside me. Damn luck.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0077" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>For a moment, I couldn’t move. The world shrank to the pavement beneath me. The rough texture, the tiny stones forming peaks and ridges, the cracks carving deep valleys. Like miniature version of Railroad Creek valley and the mountains of Glacier Park. An asphalt topographic map, and I drew the contours, sketching imaginary elevations.</p>
<p>The sound of a truck, downshifting and slowing with air brakes, snapped me from my reverie. I saw nothing until I turned around. A truck bore down on me from the west. Not completely standing up, I scrambled for the shoulder. The truck rolled to a stop about twenty feet from where the bike lay across his lane.</p>
<p>The driver jumped out of the truck and ran over to me, "Are you okay? Are you okay?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0080" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I'm okay. Just stunned." The bike lay on its left side on the pavement. The handle bars turned hard downward</p>
<p>"I didn't see you go down. What happened?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0082" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked up at him. "I'm an idiot. I fucked up the turn." Not willing to tell him that I crashed on my very first motorcycle ride. "Can you help me pick it back up?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0083" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We hefted it up and rolled it over to the shoulder of the road, and leaned it on its stand.  The left rearview mirror had no glass, its stem folded almost parallel to the handlebars.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0084" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He stood there glaring at me. "You sure you're ok?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0085" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I brushed some dust off my pants and jacket.  The left elbow had torn open. The left knee, too. Minor scrapes. Gonna have some bruises. "I'm ok."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0086" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You ought to have a helmet." He scowled at me and shook his head.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0087" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I don't have one." I wasn't going to tell him that I didn't own a motorcycle either. "I live right here." I pointed at the Railroad Creek Ranch sign. "Thank you for stopping to help." I hoped that would dismiss him.</p>
<p>Another couple of cars approached from either direction—crawling by,  gawking at my embarrassment.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm just going to ride back down home." I pointed to the cluster of cabins at the Railroad Creek Ranch.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0090" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He gave me a stern look and walked back to his truck and pulled away. I waited until he disappeared around the next curve before I got back on the bike.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0091" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It wouldn't start. Lying on its side, the bike's fuel flooded into the carburetor.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0092" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Five minutes. Standing on the road like a hitchhiker.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0093" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>One car slowed like they wanted to stop to help. I rejected the assistance by turning my back to them. They drove on.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0094" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The engine belched out dark exhaust in its first successful restart. I followed the steps of the program: clutch in, first gear down, throttle roll. The wind kept blowing my beard into my face. I tried to stuff it down my shirt, but wind always yanked it back out. Gotta live with it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0095" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Needed to know how to stop. I practiced stopping and starting on the highway shoulder all the way into the town of East Glacier. A few cars whipped by me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0096" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Riding through town gave me no trouble. The crowds of tourists wouldn't come until Memorial Day weekend. Weeks away.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0097" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Once on the far side of town, the road straightened out as it crossed Two Medicine Creek and entered the high plains of the Blackfeet Reservation.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0098" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Changed my strategy. Need speed to get there.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0099" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I accelerated  to fifty and moved into the proper place in the travel lane.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0100" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The sun had warmed my skin, but the wind was cold. Need gloves. Bandana. Hair ties.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0101" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As I flew by one of the glacial tarns so common on the plains, a mayfly splattered on my dark glasses. I just kept my speed constant, peering through the mess on the left lens. Wanted to stop to clean it, but time pressure kept me moving.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0102" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Everybody passed me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0103" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Shifting up and down for the hills felt effortless at speed; it was only the slow stuff that felt sketchy. The curves were so easy. Just a lean. Handlebars not involved.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0104" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I laughed. Terrified, but what a thrill. So fucking crazy to do this.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0105" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The engine rumbled between my legs, vibrating my balls, the wind tearing past making my skin buzz.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0106" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It's the same living-in-the-body feeling of riding a fast single track on the mountain bike. But times ten.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0107" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Freedom. Natural. Like I was born to do this. I got a hard-on.</p>
<p>I was fucking hooked.</p>
<h2 id="BlackfeetCommunityCollege">Blackfeet Community College</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0110" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>In Browning, I faced traffic and turns. Slower speed turning was nothing like the highway. I wobbled a lot.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0111" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After waiting to make a left turn into the school parking lot, I fumbled the clutch, put the bike in second instead of first, then killed the engine. The oncoming truck didn't slow down. Held the clutch, put my boots on the pavement and pushed the bike out of the lane. He laid on his horn, but I didn't look at him. Humiliating.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0112" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Pushed through the door eager to see one of the wall clocks in the corridor. Early. Five minutes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0113" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I powered down the hallway, ducking into the teachers lounge. Way more people than normal this late in the afternoon. I moved sideways into the crowd toward the counter top in the rear. Sometimes score a leftover doughnut.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0114" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Grant approved," "such a relief."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0115" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>No time to ask about it. Sounds good, though.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0116" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>No doughnut.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0117" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shut my eyes and stopped at the classroom threshold.  Composed. Confident. Speak with authority. The son of an attorney.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0118" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I had mixed feelings about teaching computer programming on the rez.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0119" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>There's a paradox to rural education programs. They train people in what local employers need or they train people to move away for work. Which one of those adds more value to the community? No corporations recruited programmers on Rez.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0120" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My stride into the room silenced the students. Three women in their thirties and five guys, just out of high school, all turned their heads to me. The women, the students most likely to engage me during a lecture, sat up front.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0121" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The guys seated in the back rarely volunteered or said anything. Each desk in the classroom had its own Apple II computer. This afforded the guys an opportunity to slouch down and hide behind their monitors.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0122" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stood behind the long table at the front of the room. This classroom suffered a distance problem: the table and the monitors separated me from them.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0123" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The white guy lecturing the natives from afar.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0124" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Last week we talked about nesting loops. Today, we're gonna have a  practical example of using nested loops to get real work done."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0125" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I balked at the expression of the women in the front: their eyes wide.  "Is there a problem?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0126" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Joan answered me. "What happened to you?" She gestured with both hands on either side of her head in a rotating motion.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0127" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I touched my own hair. A complete wind blown mess tangled and sticking out every which way.  I finger brushed it. At least hanging down instead of out. "Oh, yeah. Kind of an adventure getting here today. I had to ride in from East Glacier on a motorcycle."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0128" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As if they had choreographed it, the five guys leaned out from behind their monitors to see.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0129" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A guy's voice had never heard spoke up. "You ride a Harley?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0130" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I wish. No, I had to borrow a Honda 'cause my car wouldn't start."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0131" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"What kind of Honda?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0132" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"CX-500." Lecture derails.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0133" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Several of the guys murmured approval.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0134" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Dale's got a Yamaha Dual Sport." He pointed to the guy across the aisle. "It's a 500."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0135" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The other guy nodded, "XT500".</p>
<p><b><span id="U0136" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>This was the most connection I had ever gotten with the guys. I lifted my left arm to display my torn jean jacket. "My first time on a bike. I got a lot to learn."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0137" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A third guy jumped in. "I broke my arm on my brother's Suzuki when I was little." He held his arm up in evidence.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0138" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Keep the engagement. Pull it back to programming.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0139" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"We're going to do something different today. No computers until lab time. Let's all just sit around the table." I gestured to the six-foot folding table that served as my lectern. "Move some chairs around this table. It'll be tight, but I want every one to be able to see."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0140" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>They hesitated like I'd asked them to do something wildly unorthodox.  Joan broke the ice, standing up to move her chair. The rest followed on, but it took a moment for them to self organize, none of them wanting to share my side of the table.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0141" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I used the time to pull my educational prop from my daypack. A deck of cards.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0142" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I said were going to do something practical with loops. We're gonna talk about sorting." I unboxed the deck and fanned them out in a ribbon spread, face up. The table was slippery, so the spread wasn't as even as I had intended.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0143" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I picked out all the clubs, then redecked the rest and set them aside. "It'll take too long to do all the cards, so we're just going to use the clubs."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0144" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I laid the cards out in a line face up for everyone to see. No order to them.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0145" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Step by step, how do you sort these cards?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0146" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>No volunteers.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0147" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"There's lots of different ways. When teaching computer programming, for some reason that isn't clear to me, we always start with the bubble sort. Watch this." I gestured at the spread. "I'm going to do this like a dumb computer."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0148" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pointed my index finger at the leftmost card, the 6. My second finger pointed at the next card: 4. "I'm gonna want all the lower cards at this end." I tapped my left hand at my left end of the spread.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0149" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Which one is lower?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0150" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Joan said, "4".</p>
<p><b><span id="U0151" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yep, let's swap them." With an index finger on each card, I slid them around each other.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0152" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Now we're gonna  look at the next two." The forked pointer of my index and second finger gestured to the 6 in its new position and the Jack next to it. "Which one is lower?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0153" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"The 6" Three people said it at once. I smiled.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0154" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No swap needed. Lets go on to the Jack and the Ace. This isn't poker, so we'll treat the Ace as a 1."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0155" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Swap 'em." Ben, the guy that never said a word in class.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0156" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I switched the two cards. We continued all the way down the spread. "Is it sorted yet?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0157" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Several nos.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0158" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"We've got go through the whole spread again and do swaps." I didn't wait for them call them out. "Watch how that Jack is bubbling up toward the left end." I looked up, delighted to see all the nods. "Watch what happens when I get to the King."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0159" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"The Jack stops and the King starts moving." Joan again.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0160" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah, that's right.  The King bubbles all the way over to the end. How many times are we going to have to go through the whole spread?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0161" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Silence again. Ben's quiet voice answered. "Same number of times as there are cards."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0162" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Exactly. That's right." I smiled at him. He looked away.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0163" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I'm going to power through the rest of the sort." I started the scanning and swapping cards as fast as I could.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0164" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No." Joan called out. She caught my error making a wrong swap.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0165" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Good call, Joan. I'm not a computer."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0166" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After another couple passes, the sort completed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0167" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"That's not how I sort things at work." Ben again.</p>
<p>"Great, can you tell me how you do sort things?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0169" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He frowned for a moment like he reviewed it in his head. "Make a big pile, take the top thing and push it to the back of the table. Go through rest of the pile sorting them into new piles on either side. Then do the same thing again for each new pile. When I run out of piles, I'm done."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0170" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My jaw dropped. He just sketched out the most succinct description of the quick sort algorithm that I had ever heard. Thinks in recursive trees.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0171" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"That's amazing. It's a famous way to sort, called Quick Sort. Most programmers don't learn that one until late in their university training. Well done."  He looked away again.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0172" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I didn't want to make Ben code a bubble sort in BASIC. He deserved a better language. Pascal or maybe Lisp. Starting him with the BASIC language was starting him crippled.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0173" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Let's show everyone how quick sort works." I swept up the bubble sort cards and joined them with the rest of the deck. "With this algorithm we can sort the whole deck in the same amount of time we just spent sorting just the club cards." Veering off the lesson plan. Shouldn't do this.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0174" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I whipped through several shuffles with fancy ruffling bridges. They gave a collective gasp.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0175" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"How'd you learn to do that?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0176" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I got through college dealing poker in Missoula."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0177" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I fanned the cards out in a face down spread. I spoke to Ben. "Pick a card, any card."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0178" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>With a tentative motion he pointed at a card in the middle of the spread. I pushed out and flipped it: 7♥.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0179" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I swept the rest of the cards up, resquared them. Not as fast as dealing, but I sorted through the whole deck in seconds. In my head, I just watched the sort decision happen on its own. All cards less than 7 went to the left pile. The higher cards went right.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0180" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Now we've got two new piles. We just do the same thing over again with each one. Pick a random middle, and redistribute them into two new lower and higher piles." I fanned out the leftmost stack in front of Joan. "Each time we do this, there's fewer and fewer cards. The job gets easier and faster."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0181" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Over the next couple minutes, each of my students got to pick a card. Everyone watched the piles shrink into an arc of individual cards. "We have just sorted a whole deck in the less time it took bubble sort to sort just one suit. Thirteen cards."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0182" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Quick sort is the best sorting algorithm I know." I looked from the table over to Ben. "What do you sort at work?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0183" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He hesitated, then recited the facts like he was on the witness stand. "I am the Shipping and Receiving file clerk."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0184" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The pencil factory.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0185" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The course syllabus in my contract required I teach the bubble sort.</p>
<p>So I taught them an inferior algorithm using an inferior language on a computer destined for obsolescence, all for jobs that would never be in their reach.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0187" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>On the day I first started this job, they told me my primary goal was to offer opportunity. I decided to teach leaving. Escape.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0188" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Ben had a bubble sort demonstration running before the any of the other students had it halfway done.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0189" style="color: #b77900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After class, I caught up to him as he left the classroom. "Hey Ben. Just want to say again, that I appreciated you telling how you sort. It really is brilliant." His blank face told me I had already lost.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0190" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Listen, if you want to go to one of the Universities... Missoula, or Bozeman. I will help you get there."</p>
<p>He looked at me as if I had suggested he should live on the moon. He turned and walked away without even declining my offer.</p>
<p>I felt like a fool.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0193" style="color: #b77900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I lingered for a minute before trudging down the corridor to joint the monthly faculty meeting.</p>
<p>"Karl, hold up a minute. Can we talk in my office?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0195" style="color: #b77900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Spun around to see my supervisor, Joseph Many Guns. Holy shit. The cards? Telling a student to change schools?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0196" style="color: #b77900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Sure." My voice quavered, like he'd caught me misbehaving. I followed him into his office. He sat behind his desk, I sat in the chair facing him. Furniture enforcing distance.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0197" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Karl, I don’t have good news. The Fed grant for the computer classes going wasn’t renewed. The Bureau made it clear they’re putting the limited dollars into core instruction, reading, math, and the vocational trades. Computers didn’t make the cut."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0198" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I sat there, blank faced, sinking into the chair.  Brace for the blow.</p>
<p>"It’s not your performance. Everyone here knows you’ve done good work with the students. This is purely about the grant not being renewed.  But as of two weeks from today, your contract here at BCC ends."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0200" style="color: #b77900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The heavy sigh escaped before I could suppress it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0201" style="color: #b77900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I know you're gonna have to think about what you’re doing next, but I’ll write you a letter of recommendation if you want it. Salish Kootenai College south of Flathead, they got their computer program funded this year. If you want, I can call over there, let ’em know you’re a skilled teacher looking for work."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0202" style="color: #b77900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I just stared at him. My income vanished. Rent. Food. Gas. "I don't know."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0203" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You don't have to go to the faculty meeting. I know this is tough."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0204" style="color: #b77900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He had a few more platitudes before we parted.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0205" style="color: #b77900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Once out of his sight, I broke into a run through the door. I fled the school, just like I've had to run away from everything else. Nobody sees my tears.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0206" style="color: #b77900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I scanned for the Subaru in the lot, then the rest of day the rolled over me.  Fuck.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0207" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>———> rewrite CUT179</p>

<h2 id="US2Westbound">US2 Westbound</h2>
<p>Back out on the highway toward East Glacier, I marveled at the wall of mountains twenty miles in front of me: White Calf, Mad Wolf, Red, Rising Wolf, Calf Robe. I imagined the landscape with its vast primal glaciers only ten thousand years ago.</p>
<p>US2 from Browning to East Glacier has three segments, all roughly equal length straight sections. With little traffic, I decided to practice controlling the bike.</p>
<p>As I had done earlier, I rode on the shoulder, speeding up and slowing down to a stop.  Each stop was a little more abrupt. I needed to figure out how much pressure it took to slide the rear tire. I feathered that rear brake until I felt that edge where kinetic friction and static friction meet. That consumed the first straight leg of the highway.</p>
<p>I took the gentle left curve where the highway stopped climbing and instead cut across a series of alternating moraine hills and pothole lakes. The Montana Department of Highways did a great job leveling and straightening this section. I could see the scars of some older incarnation of the highway cutting and weaving through the potholes. The high points had road cuts, the low points and ponds had fill dirt. In this section, I practiced my front brake tests. Over and over I finessed the right brake lever that had betrayed me a couple of hours earlier. I searched for that sweet spot without flipping the bike again.</p>
<p>Taking the next gentle curve to the right, I entered the final straight section. I repeated the same tests with both brakes, seeking the golden ratio between the right-hand lever and the right-foot pedal for the shortest stopping distance. Tempted, but I did not try an all-out emergency stop—can't learn it all today.</p>
<p>Hands got really cold—maybe my ski gloves would work. Spending money on proper riding gloves would mean missing a meal later this Summer. No income—can’t spend money on things I didn't really need. With warm weather ahead, I wasn't chopping wood for Gladys. That meant I owed more for rent. No paycheck—what the fuck was I gonna do?</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, beyond East Glacier, I rode up to my inaugural crash site.  I waited for a pair of trucks, then I turned onto the gravel. My shoulders tensed as I entered the deeper gravel just off the pavement, but the bike pushed through just fine. I carefully rode the gravel back to the woodshed and got the bike parked.</p>
<p>Even though I buzzed with elation from the ride, a wave of sadness closed over me—like walking away from a new friend before we were done. I didn't want to stop. I wanted to keep going. I wasn’t done with this. I didn't think I could ever be done with this.</p>
<p>I pushed through the back door of the café to put the key away. Gladys sat in the office. Her cook must have finally arrived. The dinner hour—the warm kitchen smelled of roast beef—the usual Wednesday special. My stomach growled.</p>
<p>She turned as I stepped in, her brow furrowed. "Oh. thank the Lord." She eyed my torn jacket and pants. "Did you get there?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's the best thing ever. It took a while to get the hang of it, but wow, that was so much fun." Didn't think it right to tell my landlady that I just lost my job.</p>
<p>Her face softened. I've never seen Gladys soften to anything.</p>
<p>"Jerry and I used to ride, way back. Been a lotta years, but I remember bein' in the wind." She actually smiled. Not sure I'd ever seen that.</p>
<p>"Any chance I can ride Bob's bike again?"</p>
<p>"Ain’t Bob’s bike. It’s mine. I paid for it. I registered it. I’ll let whoever the hell I want ride it." She paused, eyeing me as if making an assessment. "Here’s the deal: your gas, your oil, your upkeep. I like knowin’ it’s gettin’ used."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but grin. Shit, paying for it—didn’t know how to pull that off.</p>
<p>"Get it outta my wood shed. Keep it in your own. After a month, if you're still alive, we can talk about you buyin' it off me."</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>Gladys dropped the smile, replaced it with a frown. "I worried about you. Never imagined you'd just take off like that, not knowing how to do it properly." Her voice turned stern. "You be careful."</p>
<p>I nodded and headed toward the back door, but she called me back.</p>
<p>"It's been a slow night. Come back down at eight, I'll feed you dinner. You can tell me how you tore your jacket and pants."</p>

<p>Now had to figure out how to get money.</p>
