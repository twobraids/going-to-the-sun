            <h2 id="RailroadCreekRanch">Railroad Creek Ranch</h2>
<p>I yanked on my jacket, slung my daypack over my shoulder, and bolted. I slammed the door behind me—wrong sound. Still running, I glanced back—damn it. The thing bounced open, swinging free instead of latching.</p>
<p>My little A-frame cabin, likely built in the sixties, had only been slapped together. Standing on too few supports, the floors all sagged. The front wall, with the door centered in the middle, had it worst. It was just a pair of oversized lean-to shelters supporting themselves on rotting piles of 4x4s.</p>
<p>I turned around, leapt back onto the deck, pulled the door properly shut, lifting hard on the doorknob to get the latch to click. I turned back, running again.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Instant decision—the trail through the woods—the road would take too long. I dashed by the subaru-that-refused-to-start—the car that made this running a fucking requirement. I ducked down the trail, weaving between the trees, leaping over the downed trunks.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Could smell it and hear it long before the creek came into view—swollen, too fast. Early May snowmelt and the overflowing beaver ponds up the valley turned my usual crossing into a churning whitewater deathtrap. Too wide—too dangerous to jump.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Can't have delays. I veered into the undergrowth parallel to the gully, crashing through the bramble, twenty yards downstream. The old ponderosa pine snag from last summer’s storm still spanned the stream banks.</p>
<p>I scrambled up onto the trunk. Arms out for balance—eyes to the other side—feet take care of themselves. Careful. Rushed. I reached the far side and leapt down into the brush.</p>
<p>No need to search to rejoin my trail—just push through. Snowberry, serviceberry, dogwood branches clawed at me as I forced my way downhill. Then—open space—the cluster of tourist cabins of Railroad Creek Ranch.</p>
<p>I ran between two closest cabins, around the parked cars, and over toward Gladys's restaurant.</p>
<p>This place may have once been an actual ranch, but since the 1950s, it had become a tourist attraction. An old hand-painted sign by the highway read, "If you want the best; Railroad Creek Ranch; Glacier National Park, Mont," followed by a list of amenities in a disquietingly random order: "Fried Chicken, Moonlight Steak Fries, Saddle Horses, Steaks, Cabins, Family Meals." I learned when I moved here two years ago that Moonlight Steak Fries just meant Gladys didn’t cook them long enough to brown properly.</p>
<p>I sprinted up the steps and pushed through the door into the dining room. Kathy, at the cash register, looked up from her romance novel, obviously expecting to see customers. "Hey, Karl, do you want a table?"</p>
<p>"No. Is Gladys in the kitchen?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. That new cook didn't show up again." She looked back down to her book.</p>
<p>I walked, not daring to run, through the dining room—smell of fried meat. Only two tables occupied. Pushed through the door into the kitchen. Gladys, in her late sixties, stood at the grill cooking hamburgers. She scowled at me from under a hairstyle of a different era. She offered no greeting.</p>
<p>This wasn't going to work.</p>
<p>"Gladys, I need a favor. I'm teaching at the reservation school in an hour, and I can't get my car started. Can I borrow your car?"</p>
<p>Her scowl deepened—braced myself for another one of her tirades about the school.</p>
<p>“That school’s a goddamn waste of time. I don’t know why the BIA thinks the tribe wants it, let alone needs it.” Yep, right on schedule, same thing she always said.</p>
<p>"Gladys, I know you don’t like it. It's my job to teach there. I need to get going. Can I borrow your car?"</p>
<p>She looked at me with her skeptical eyes. "No. Go hitchhike."</p>
<p>"Not fast enough, and I doubt anybody would stop for me."</p>
<p>She looked up from the grill with her old-lady scowl—so like my mother's. "Take Bob's bike. The key's on the rack in the office."</p>
<p>"Um, I don't know how to ride."</p>
<p>"Well, I guess you're not teachin', are ya'?" She turned away to flip the burgers—my dismissal.</p>
<p>I'd get no more help from her, so I walked into the office. I spotted the bike key on the hooks by its stubby shape. I stood there staring at it.</p>
<p>That scowl—thinking back at Mother standing behind Dad—his raised voice like a cudgel.</p>
<p>"As a homosexual, you're just another criminal, a crook." My father passed his sentence in his cold, courtroom voice. "You have no right to own a home. You have no right to have a job. You have two hours to go gather what you want to keep, then you're out."</p>
<p>That same sort of panicked rush all over again—got to move quickly.</p>
<p>I didn't resist it. I used it—grabbed the key, and pushed through the screen door.</p>
<p>The Bible condemned me. The State of Montana condemned me. My father condemned me. My life just didn't matter. No matter what I chose to do—stacked deck, rigged game.</p>
<p>I stomped up to the bike sitting in the open wood shed not five yards away. Still a whole cord of wood left over—one of my labors for Gladys in lieu of rent.</p>
<p>Bob's bike, a Honda CX500 Deluxe with a maroon tank, sat abandoned, covered with dust and pine needles.</p>
<p>Bob was Gladys's younger son, about the same age as me. We never got along. He spent his days shooting up cans with his rifle out behind the restaurant. He and his old Toyota truck vanished last Fall. Never knew where he went, never really cared. I got to take over his chores for Gladys. I couldn't otherwise afford the rent.</p>
<p>I stood  breathing, focusing on the bike, trying to figure out what I needed to do—steeling myself. Motorcycles would be like riding bicycles, just faster—a lot faster. I brushed off dust and some of the pine needles from the seat, tank, and handlebars. No time for a thorough cleaning.</p>
<p>Just below the gas tank, a small lever caught my eye—a petcock valve? Leaning in, I saw three markings. ON made sense. OFF made sense. RES meant nothing to me. I turned it to ON.</p>
<p>I knew motorcycles had transmissions—so there had to be a clutch and a shifter—but where the hell were they? I found the shifter on the left side of the transmission case—foot operated. I followed a cable from the transmission to the left handle bar—clutch found.</p>
<p>Now, needed to find the brakes—pedal on right—seemed like the right resistance. Rear brake. That meant the right grip lever was the front brake.</p>
<p>A wave of fear spread out from chest.</p>
<p>I followed the cable and, sure enough, front brake—exactly the opposite of a bicycle. Damn, I need instinct to work with me not against—one mistake—I'd end up flying over the handlebars.</p>
<p>I spent the next few moments with the thumb switches. Off/Run, Start, Hi/Lo, turn signals—everything looked intelligible.</p>
<p>Research time was over. I needed to go. I jammed the key into the slot below the speedometer and twisted it to “On.” The indicator light flicked on—good, the battery survived the winter. I pulled the clutch, thumbed the “Start” button.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>I scanned the switches on the hand grips. Run/Stop switch. I flipped it to “Run”, hit the starter again. The buzz of the starter motor, then the engine turned over—but didn’t fire.</p>
<p>Choke—hadn't found that yet. Carb has got to be on the top side. The tank blocked my view—only saw bundles of cables.</p>
<p>Back at the left hand grip, I caught sight of a lever. I pushed it with my left thumb and tried again. This time, the engine chugged a couple times but didn’t catch. Try again. Another stab at the starter—it caught, sputtered, coughed. Blue exhaust—burning oil stench—gas odor filled the shed. I nudged the choke back. The idle steadied.</p>
<p>Do I have to let it warm up? No time to wait.</p>
<p>Tweaked the choke like that old lawn mower from back home until the idle evened out.  Revved the engine—couple quick twists of the throttle. As I let go—backfire—like one of Bob's rifle shots. I jumped as if he'd tried to force me off his bike.</p>
<p>Clutch in. Foot down on the shifter. A solid clunk. First gear—I hoped. I eased the clutch and rolled on the throttle—too fast. The bike lurched forward, snapping my head back, then died. Damn it. No finesse. Just like driving stick—clutch control means everything.</p>
<p>No time for hesitation. I hit the starter again. Engine caught. This time, I let the clutch out even slower, feathering it, easing the throttle. The bike crawled forward—I walked it along with my boots still on the ground  until I felt steady, then lifted them onto the pegs.</p>
<p>Speed crept up. The engine whined—time for second. Clutch in, roll off throttle, kick that shifter up. Another clunk from the transmission. Clutch out, roll throttle. First time in my life riding a motorcycle—fifteen miles per hour. Half a mile to the stop sign at the highway. No way in hell I was trying for third gear on this gravel.</p>
<p>The road curved gently toward the stop sign. I let off the throttle to slow down—then the gravel got deeper. The bike wobbled, the rear tire sliding in the loose rock—panic. I clenched the bars—bad move. I didn’t mean to roll the throttle.</p>
<p>The rear tire spun, spitting gravel. The bike fish-tailed, then suddenly grabbed traction on the hardpack under the loose crushed stone. It launched forward—right onto the highway.</p>
<p>No time to check for traffic.</p>
<p>I crossed onto the asphalt, aimed straight across the lanes—straight for the other embankment—straight for the raging Railroad Creek. My mountain biking instincts kicked in but betrayed me. I threw my weight left, ready to skid the rear tire, hoping to swing the bike around and line up with the road instead of launching off it.</p>
<p>None of it worked.</p>
<p>With my lean, I yanked the right-hand lever—wrong move. I predicted this error, but fell into it anyway. This wasn’t a mountain bike. Front brake, not rear—front tire locked—the bike went down.</p>
<p>My left shoulder hit the asphalt hard, taking the brunt of the impact from my head. No helmet—nobody rides with a helmet in Montana. The bike crashed down beside me, gratefully, not on top of me.</p>
<p>For a moment, I couldn’t move. The world shrank to the pavement beneath me—the rough texture, the tiny stones forming peaks and ridges, the cracks carving deep valleys. Railroad Creek. The mountains of Glacier Park. The asphalt beneath me was a topographic map, and my dazed brain started mapping its contours, sketching imaginary elevations.</p>
<p>The sound of a truck, downshifting and slowing with air brakes, snapped me from my reverie. I looked down the highway and saw nothing, but then turned my head and saw the truck bearing down on me from the other direction. Not completely standing up, I scrambled for the shoulder. The truck rolled to a stop about twenty feet from where the bike lay across his lane.</p>
<p>The driver jumped out of the truck and ran over to me, "Are you okay? Are you okay?"</p>
<p>"I'm okay. Just stunned." My eyes locked on the bike in utter dismay.</p>
<p>"I didn't see you go down. What happened?"</p>
<p>"I'm an idiot. I fucked up the turn." Not willing to tell him that I crashed not two minutes into my very first motorcycle ride. "Can you help me pick it back up?"</p>
<p>We walked over to the poor thing lying on its side. We hefted it up and rolled it over to the shoulder of the road, and leaned it on its stand.  The right rearview mirror, its stem folded almost parallel to the handlebars, no longer held glass.</p>
<p>"Jeez, lucky bastard," he said, "it doesn't really look scraped up too much. Even the bars still look straight. You must not have been going very fast."</p>
<p>I looked down at myself and realized the left elbow of my jacket had torn open, as had the left knee of my pants. I had some minor scrapes, but essentially unscathed. I felt the side of my head for blood. I found a welt, but no leakage.</p>
<p>"You ought to have a helmet."</p>
<p>"I don't own one." I wasn't going to tell him that I didn't own a motorcycle either. "I live right here." I pointed at the Railroad Creek Ranch sign. "Thank you for stopping to help." I hoped that would dismiss him.</p>
<p>Another couple of cars approached from either direction—crawling by,  gawking at my embarrassment.</p>
<p>"You sure you're okay?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm just going to ride back down home." I pointed to the cluster of cabins at the Railroad Creek Ranch.</p>
<p>He gave me a stern look and walked back to his truck, pulling away. I waited until he disappeared around the next curve before I remounted the bike. It wouldn't start. Lying on its side, the fuel had flooded the carburetor. I just waited, worrying about the time.</p>
<p>It didn't take long and I got the engine running again. I repeated all the steps that I had done earlier getting the bike up to about twenty miles per hour riding down the road's shoulder. Once I got comfortable, I upshifted to third. Then I realized, I need to know how to stop. I practiced up shifting, speeding up and downshifting, slowing down on the highway shoulder all the way into the town of East Glacier.</p>
<p>Riding through town gave me no trouble. It won't be crowded with tourists until Memorial Day weekend at the end of the month. Once on the far side of town, the road straightens out as it crosses Two Medicine Creek and enters the high plains of the Blackfeet Reservation. Now wanting to get to the school as quickly as I could, I sped up to fifty and moved into the proper place in my lane.</p>
<p>The sun had warmed my skin, but the air was cold.  I wished I had gloves. As I crossed Two Medicine Creek, an errant mayfly splattered on the left lens of my dark glasses. I felt the splash of its internal juices on my cheek.</p>
<p>Most other traffic passed me, I just kept my speed constant.</p>
<p>Shifting up and down felt effortless at speed; it was only the slow stuff that felt sketchy. Halfway to Browning, it hit me—I was having one hell of a good time. I started to laugh, a terrified laugh, but a laugh nevertheless. The engine rumbled between my legs, vibrating my balls, the wind tearing past stimulating my skin. It's the same living-in-the-body feeling of riding a fast single track on the mountain bike—times ten. Freedom. Natural. Like I was born to do this—gave me a hard-on.</p>
<p>Turning a motorcycle is far more instinctive than I expected. On a bicycle, the faster the speed, the more turning is done by weight shifting, not with the handlebars. Leaning the bike onto the sides of rounded tires does the turning. The spinning wheels create gyroscopic stability, keeping the bike upright. It's incredibly simple to slightly lean onto those tire sidewalls.</p>
<p>I was fucking hooked.</p>
<h2 id="BlackfeetCommunityCollege">Blackfeet Community College</h2>
<p>Once I arrived in Browning, I had to contend with traffic and turns. After waiting to make a left turn into the school parking lot, I killed the engine at an awkward time. I had to put my feet on the ground and walk the bike out of the lane because I got flustered in trying to restart the bike quickly with traffic bearing down on me.</p>
<p>Got to my classroom about three minutes late. I'm usually there about twenty minutes early to set up and gather my thoughts for the day's lecture, but, of course, I had no time today. I am fortunate in that I can wing it pretty well, sounding composed and confident even when I am not. I think my ability to speak in public is the best deception I've ever devised—the true son of a lawyer, perhaps the only useful lesson he ever taught me.</p>
<p>I had mixed feelings about teaching computer programming on the rez.</p>
<p>There's a paradox to rural education programs. They must either train people in what local employers need or train people to move away. Which one of those adds more value to the community? No corporations were recruiting programmers on Blackfeet lands.</p>
<p>I didn't want to teach BASIC programming on a Apple II, I wanted to teach structured problem solving. My contract said to teach programming, I tried my best to combine them.</p>
<p>Today's lecture topic: sorting. I asked the students how they sorted things. I gave an example of sorting a hundred file folders. Most of my students had no idea how they sorted things, they just did it.</p>
<p>Getting my students to speak up always challenged me. I had only eight students: three women in their thirties, the rest, guys a couple years out from high school. The guys never said anything. The women were always the ones that responded to my questions. This time even they stayed silent. Not a good sign.</p>
<p>I demonstrated the classic elementary sorting algorithm for beginning programmers, the bubble sort. I knew I wandered out on a limb. My students seemed to have a good grip on the concept of a programming loop structure. However, once one is embedded into another, they no longer understood. I even tried the classic odometer analogy, where each subsequent digit is represented by embedding another loop. I struggled with making this clear.</p>
<p>After explaining the double loop of the sort, one of the quiet guys in the back raised his hand. "That isn't how I sort things at work."</p>
<p>"Great, can you tell me how you do sort things?"</p>
<p>He frowned for a moment like he reviewed it in his head. "Make a big pile, take the top thing and push it to the back of the table. Go through rest of the pile sorting them into new piles on either side. Then do the same thing again for each new pile. When you run out of piles, you're done."</p>
<p>I just heard the most succinct description of the quick sort algorithm that I had ever encountered: pure algorithmic genius.   I had only encountered this recursive algorithm in 400 level undergraduate work. He didn't think in terms of the non-recursive BASIC programming language. He used an intuitive understanding.</p>
<p>I desperately wanted to give him an expressive language programming language like Logo or Lisp. Starting students with the BASIC language was starting them out crippled.</p>
<p>I commended him for his sorting method and identified its name for him. Sadly, then I had to tell him that it's a great algorithm but really difficult to implement in BASIC.</p>
<p>So I taught them an inferior algorithm using an inferior language on a computer destined for obsolescence, all for jobs that would never be in their reach.</p>
<p>I made the decision to teach escaping. After all, wasn't I so good at that myself? I relived my flight from home, taking only what I could stuff in the back of the Subaru. I thought about rolling on the throttle of that motorcycle, a machine made for escaping.</p>
<p>After class, I caught up with the quick-sort-student as he left the classroom. I asked if he had ever considered going to one of the universities in Bozeman or Missoula. I told him I would help him make connections with the people that could make it happen.</p>
<p>He looked at me as if I had suggested he should live on the moon. He turned and walked away without even declining my offer.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0099" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I felt like a fool.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0100" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stood there for a few moments, before turning toward the exit.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0101" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Karl, hold up a minute. Can we talk in my office?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0102" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Spun around to see my supervisor, Joseph Bear Kills Twice. Holy shit—did I fuck up talking to a student switching to one of the universities?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0103" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Sure." My voice quavered for a moment, like he'd caught me misbehaving. I followed him into his office. As he seated himself behind his desk, I sat in the chair.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0104" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Karl, I don’t have good news. The grant from the Feds to keep the computer classes going wasn’t renewed this year. The Bureau made it clear they’re putting the limited dollars into core instruction, reading, math, and the vocational trades. Computers didn’t make the cut."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0105" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I sat there, blank faced, knowing full well what was to happen next.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0106" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"It’s not your performance. Everyone here knows you’ve done good work with the students. This is purely about the grant not being renewed.  But as of two weeks from today, your contract here at BCC ends."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0107" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I let out a heavy sigh.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0108" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I know you're gonna have to think about what you’re doing next, but I’ll write you a letter of recommendation if you need it. Salish Kootenai College south of Flathead, they got their computer program funded this year. If you want, I can call over there, let ’em know you’re a skilled teacher looking for work."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0109" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I just looked at him for a moment as my income vanished in front of me. "I don't know. I live here. It's my home. That's two and half hours away."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0110" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He had a few more platitudes, but I wanted out of there as quickly as possible.</p>
<hr>
<p>I walked out of the building, anxious to roll on that throttle and feel the acceleration. Breaking into a run, I fled the school, just like I fled everything else.</p>
<p>In the parking lot, I stood by the bike, just looking at it. So much crud from the wood shed still on it. I brushed some webs off between the gas tank and the frame.</p>
<p>Gas tank.</p>
<p>I never even checked the gas tank level before I rode out. Scanned the top of the tank, the speedometer—no gas gauge. I opened the gas cap—too dark to see.</p>
<p>I mounted it, leaned it off the side stand and then wobbled the bike with my legs. It sloshed, clearly not full, but not near empty either. No need to learn how to gas it up today.</p>
<h2 id="US-2Westbound">US-2 Westbound</h2>
<p>Back out on the highway toward East Glacier, I marveled at the wall of mountains twenty miles in front of me: White Calf, Mad Wolf, Red, Rising Wolf, Calf Robe. I imagined the landscape with its vast primal glaciers only ten thousand years ago.</p>
<p>US2 from Browning to East Glacier has three segments, all roughly equal length straight sections. With little traffic, I decided to practice controlling the bike.</p>
<p>As I had done earlier, I rode on the shoulder, speeding up and slowing down to a stop.  Each stop was a little more abrupt. I needed to figure out how much pressure it took to slide the rear tire. I feathered that rear brake until I felt that edge where kinetic friction and static friction meet. That consumed the first straight leg of the highway.</p>
<p>I took the gentle left curve where the highway stopped climbing and instead cut across a series of alternating moraine hills and pothole lakes. The Montana Department of Highways did a great job leveling and straightening this section. I could see the scars of some older incarnation of the highway weaving cutting and weaving through the potholes. The high points had road cuts, the low points and ponds had fill dirt. In this section, I practiced my front brake tests. Over and over I finessed the right brake lever that had betrayed me a couple of hours earlier. I searched for that sweet spot without flipping the bike again.</p>
<p>Taking the next gentle curve to the right, I entered the final straight section. I repeated the same tests with both brakes, seeking the golden ratio between the right-hand lever and the right-foot pedal for the shortest stopping distance. Tempted, but I did not try an all-out emergency stop—can't learn it all today.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0123" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Hands got really cold—maybe my ski gloves would work. Spending money on proper riding gloves would mean missing a meal later this Summer. No income—can’t spend money on things I didn't really need. With warm weather ahead, I wasn't chopping wood for Gladys. That meant I owed more for rent. No paycheck—what the fuck was I gonna do?</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, beyond East Glacier, I rode up to my inaugural crash site.  I waited for a pair of trucks, then I turned onto the gravel. My shoulders tensed as I entered the deeper gravel just off the pavement, but the bike pushed through just fine. I carefully rode the gravel back to the woodshed and got the bike parked.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0125" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Even though I buzzed with elation from the ride, a wave of sadness closed over me—like walking away from a new friend before we were done. I didn't want to stop. I wanted to keep going. I wasn’t done with this. I didn't think I could ever be done with this.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0126" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pushed through the back door of the café to put the key away. Gladys sat in the office. Her cook must have finally arrived. The dinner hour—the warm kitchen smelled of roast beef—the usual Wednesday special. My stomach growled.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0127" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She turned as I stepped in, her brow furrowed. "Oh. thank the Lord." She eyed my torn jacket and pants. "Did you get there?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0128" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yes, it's the best thing ever. It took a while to get the hang of it, but wow, that was so much fun." Didn't think it right to tell my landlady that I just lost my job.</p>
<p>Her face softened. I've never seen Gladys soften to anything.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0130" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Jerry and I used to ride, way back. Been a lotta years, but I remember bein' in the wind." She actually smiled. Not sure I'd ever seen that.</p>
<p>"Any chance I can ride Bob's bike again?"</p>
<p>"Ain’t Bob’s bike. It’s mine. I paid for it. I registered it. I’ll let whoever the hell I want ride it." She paused, eyeing me as if making an assessment. "Here’s the deal: your gas, your oil, your upkeep. I like knowin’ it’s gettin’ used."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0133" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I couldn't help but grin. Shit, paying for it—didn’t know how to pull that off.</p>
<p>"Get it outta my wood shed. Keep it in your own. After a month, if you're still alive, we can talk about you buyin' it off me."</p>
<p>"Thank you."</p>
<p>Gladys dropped the smile, replaced it with a frown. "I worried about you. Never imagined you'd just take off like that, not knowing how to do it properly." Her voice turned stern. "You be careful."</p>
<p>I nodded and headed toward the back door, but she called me back.</p>
<p>"It's been a slow night. Come back down at eight, I'll feed you dinner. You can tell me how you tore your jacket and pants."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0139" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Jesus—what a fuck up of emotions—no job, no money. But I smiled—couldn't stop if I tried.</p>
<p>I got back on the bike, coasted down to where my road forks—brief front tire skid on the gravel of the tight turn, but I recovered. My road's kind of rough and rutted in a few places. I'd have to practice.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0141" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Now had to figure out how to get money.</p>
