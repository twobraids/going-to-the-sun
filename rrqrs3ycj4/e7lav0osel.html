            <h2 id="GoatLick,Montana">Goat Lick, Montana</h2>
<p>US2 westbound—I stood on the edge of the highway overlooking Goat Lick—a gorge made by the Middle Fork of the Flathead. No riverbanks—just steep talus slopes of oddly white crumbling rock stained with rust red streaks pointing down into the whitewater river.</p>
<p>Across the the top of the largest mountainside scar, an improbable BN freight train crawled on level tracks. The juxtaposition of engineering and the raw unstable geology defied sense—didn't look real.</p>
<p>I had seen this flash by countless times—today I stopped to marvel at it. Without any sort of proper pullout for gawking, it felt dicey to stand sandwiched between full speed highway traffic and the ribbon of guard rail on a shoulder barely wide enough for the bike.</p>
<p>Didn't matter—I watched the train until the end. Another train without caboose. Has a railroad era really ended?</p>
<p>I remounted the bike—facing west on the eastbound shoulder—and took off, chasing and then pacing the train on the mountainside across the valley. Eventually, the valley widened and the railroad and highway chose diverging routes for a dozen miles. I pulled way in front and lost sight of the locomotives.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="HungryHorse,Montana">Hungry Horse, Montana</h2>
<p>I passed through West Glacier, and prepared for the speed-up slow-down routine of the next twelve miles—four small towns in rapid succession, each with town speed limits and very short full speed highway sections between them. I needed to pass several cars to get myself in the best position for the curves in Badrock Canyon. I didn't want anyone in front of me so I could take the curves at my own speed.</p>
<p>I passed an eighteen wheeler between Belton and Corum. Got around another couple cars between Corum and Martin City. Hungry Horse—speed down to thirty-five, the biggest of the towns, I prayed nobody would pull into that clear highway ahead.</p>
<p>No such luck. A local's pickup pulled in just before the bridge over the Flathead river. The other side, the speed limit went back to fifty-five and the curves began. Half way across the bridge, the truck's left turn signal came on. My heart leapt—they headed to the fishing access road.</p>
<p>Moments later I had my clear lane ahead of me. Satisfied grin—I accelerated, kicking it into fourth.</p>
<p>One car on the shoulder ahead—flashing hazards. I moved to the left toward the double yellow—set fly by them and into the lean for the first curve.</p>
<p>Suddenly—the car moved—turned broadside across my lane—a fucking U-turn.</p>
<p>Hard on the rear brake—just a split second—off the throttle. Dump speed fast—off the brake—like my heart collided with my ribs. Counter steer left—lean hard right, take the bike with me. Riding the sidewalls, the right foot peg scraped the fog line. Yank the bike back upright. Counter steer right—lean hard left—front tire chirped, but held.</p>
<p>Holy shit, holy shit.</p>
<p>Now flying upright along the shoulder—slicing the car's late morning shadow—eyes on the car’s rear bumper—left foot peg, inches of clearance—orange license plate—Reagan/Bush bumper sticker.</p>
<p>Kicking up gravel behind. Wood debris ahead. Quick reverse it—lean hard left and snap right—back in the travel lane, upright—guard rail banking left dead ahead—leaned left into the first curve of Badrock Canyon. Roll the throttle out of the curve. Goddamn—the torque of this machine—no need to downshift.</p>
<p>Too late to look in the mirror—nothing to see but the river beyond the curved asphalt. Breathe dammit, breathe.</p>
<p>I swallowed hard. Focus on staying alive—taking each curve as it presented itself. Took only a moment to glance up at that one cliff outcrop that juts out over the highway—gonna fall someday.</p>
<p>A dozen tight curves behind me, I streaked out of Badrock Canyon, a mile before the turn into Columbia Falls.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="TheIronHorse">The Iron Horse</h2>
<p>Ten minutes later, I coasted into the Horse's empty parking lot with my heart still pounding. I swung the bike into the spot near the front door. Place looked closed—nobody around. I just sat there with my boots firmly planted on the ground, reliving that swerve around the idiot in the Chevy. I could still see him, head turned the wrong way—never even knew I was there.</p>
<p>"You Karl?"</p>
<p>I jerked in surprise having neither seen nor heard the guy step up. My ears still rang from the wind noise. "Yeah."</p>
<p>"Snake said you might roll in early. C’mon ‘round back—no sense bakin’ out here in the sun. Name’s Grizz."</p>
<p>Still on the bike, I turned to look. The name fit—big burly guy with a fierce wide reddish beard, probably about 30. Sounded like he said, "Snake"—didn't make sense.</p>
<p>He stopped, taking a closer look at me. "Something happen?" He said to me with his head slightly cocked to the side.</p>
<p>My head turned back forward on the bike and saw both my hands, white knuckles still on the bars. I let out a long breath and let go. "Some ass in a Chevy pulled a fucking U-turn from the shoulder right in front of me. Missed by inches. I was doin’ sixty just this side of Hungry Horse before Bad Rock.”</p>
<p>"What was it—clueless Iowa flatlander or a rez buck with a baling wire  bumper?"</p>
<p>I hesitated, thinking of the driver’s turned head. "Never saw his face.  Orange plate, though. Don't know what state's orange..."</p>
<p>I shoved the side stand down, leaned the bike onto it, and dismounted.</p>
<p>Grizz towered over me.  He offered his hand—we clasped wrists.  He turned to walk away. "C'mon around to the shade, we've got the patio open."</p>
<p>I followed him along the west side of the building and then around to the back. The mainline of the BN paralleled the building with a gap about the width of US2. I got the impression that Horse's brick building formerly served as a truck engine shop for the old Great Northern Railroad.</p>
<p>The rear wall consisted of four garage doors tall enough for big rigs.  The second from the right stood open revealing the card room. I had to stand and look at for a minute. I'd swear that there were only three bay doors in the card room. A couple tables sat on the apron in front of the gaping door. What was behind door number four?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I smiled as I saw Dolph sitting at a table that had been dragged out from the card room. He looked up from a spiral bound notepad.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Howdy, Dolph. Nice to see you again."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He nodded a silent greeting, then went straight back to his notepad.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Griz and I sat down at the table. He peered like he struggled to figure me out. "So uh… what makes you so special? Snake says the whole club supposed to get to know you or somethin’."</p>
<p>"Whaddaya mean?" I didn't know anything about this.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I spotted Dolf closing his notepad and frowning at Grizz.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A low slowly pulsing rumble started to vibrate the air. Train coming—that gang of Burlington Northern SD40s pulling a mile long string of grainers that I saw at Goat Lick.</p>
<p>Grizz noticed Dolf's frown and backed down. "Not sayin’ nothin’ bad, I’m just askin’. That’s all." He pasted an obviously fake smile on his face and looked back to me.</p>
<p>"I don't know anything about what Snake said, let alone why he said it, or even who the hell he is. It's news to me. I'm just a card dealer. Gimme a minute, I'm gonna checkout this train."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The train’s turbo whine spooled up as it accelerated west on the first straight run out of Bad Rock Canyon. I got up and walked toward the tracks, forgetting all about Grizz and Dolph in my eagerness to stand on the right of way. No fence dividing the far side of bar's concrete patio expanse and the ballast of the tracks.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I waited for the first engine to thunder by and then stepped off the concrete onto the track ballast for the trailing power units—didn't want to alarm the engineer and conductor. I shut my eyes and reveled in the power of the diesels and the reverberation in my chest. Kinda like the bike, but deeper—stronger.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stood there for the whole train to pass feeling the vibration, basking in the accompanying wind. I needed to get that car out of my head—replace the bad thrill with a good one.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0048" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As the last car glided by, I swung around to face the blinking red light and watched it recede toward Whitefish, that iron on iron squeal rapidly dropping in volume.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I wandered back to the table without explaining myself.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0050" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Grizz’s jaw hung slack, eyebrows pinched—he clearly thought I was nuts—not the first one coming to that conclusion.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0051" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I let him think about it then looked him straight in the eye. "It's a great rush. You oughta try it."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0052" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I caught that skeptical flicker in his eye. I went all in, daring him to call the hand I knew he couldn't beat.  "The real rush is climbing up under the tracks at end of a trestle.  You can lie down just under the ties. When the locomotives roll over, it's a rush like ya can't believe."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Griz shook his head. "Where'd you come from?"</p>
<p>"I live on the Blackfeet Rez near East Glacier."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He nodded as if I had just explained everything odd about me. "Dealing on the rez? Huh. That new, or under the table like everything over there?"</p>
<p>"No, of course not, there's no card rooms on the Rez. I was teaching at the tribal college."</p>
<p>He shot me another what-the-hell stare. "Teachin'? Why do the injuns need to learn to deal cards? That's all we need a bunch of bucks at the card tables."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>What the fuck? This guy got ahold of the wrong idea and ran with it.   "Jesus Christ, no." I shook my head at "bucks"—as if the men of the tribe didn't even qualify as people. "I taught computer programming."</p>
<p>He stared at me for an awkward moment. "Computers? Figures." He turned to Dolph. "We lettin’ the scrawny nerds run the poker tables now?"</p>
<p>This was a goddamn test—he's baiting me. I glanced over at Dolph. He just looked at me as if waiting to see my reaction. Has everyone gotta test me today?</p>
<p>Can't start off my first day making enemies. I gotta turn this guy around and make him like me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0062" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Smile, nod—just agree with him. "Yup, I'm a bona fide nerd, but here today as a card dealer. They hired me to run a table, I'm here to do my job."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0063" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked over at Dolph and then back to Grizz. "Since you’re hanging here with Dolph, I'm guessing you're security, one of the bouncers—dealers like me rely on you guys. You protect me, the cards, and my toke box. What's the worst you've seen? Does it get bad here?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0064" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Grizz's face lit up. "Coupla weeks ago, these college kids stumble outta the bar. I'm watchin' from the lot, just lettin' 'em clear out. One of 'em—tall shit in a MSU Bobcat t-shirt—gets this genius idea to jump onto Carnie's chopper, playin' like he's ridin'.” He leaned toward me, like he needed to clue me in. “That’s the club president’s bike. You’ll probably meet him today."</p>
<p>Carnie?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0066" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As his hand gestures got larger, he built up to the climax of his story. "Didn't shout. Didn't warn 'em. I walk over, grab him by the collar, and bounce his head off the asphalt—twice, just to be sure he remembers. His buddies step up and I decked 'em before they even knew what happened. They limped outta the lot fast with piss in their pants."</p>
<p>I nodded and smiled, doing my best to look impressed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0068" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Nobody touches Carnie’s scoot. Not on my watch.” Grizz returned my smile. “Carnie is a great guy. You always show him respect. He’s the boss. Ya gotta do what he says.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0069" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It dawned on me—Carnie is Vince, duh. Could Snake be Chris?</p>
<p>I thought about Vince and me swapping blowjobs last weekend. Grizz had no clue how well I already knew the president—I nodded to him, accepting his advice.</p>
<p>A new rumble rolled in—deep and familiar, not a train this time. Harleys. Choppers.</p>
<p>I grinned. "That’s Vince and Chris now. Doesn’t sound like he’s fixed that pushrod issue yet." I looked directly at Grizz.</p>
<p>Dolph closed his notepad. "Yup. Doin' that since last Summer. Lifters been trouble since he built it."</p>
<p>Grizz gave me a puzzled look. I could see the question cross his mind—how's this nerdy little fucker know anything about the President's chopper?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0075" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked to Dolph. "So Carnie is Vince? That mean Chris is Snake?"</p>
<p>Dolph nodded to me silently.</p>
<p>About two minutes later, Vince strode into the cardroom through the door to the bar, heading straight for our table just outside in the shade. He didn’t even glance at the others. Just came straight to me.</p>
<p>"Karl! Buddy—glad you’re joinin’ the crew today. Gonna be a hell of a good weekend."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0079" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stood up, stepped toward Vince with my hand out. Instead reaching for my handshake, he pulled me into a fraternal bear hug, slapping me on the back a couple times. He released the hug, and turned to face the table. With his arm still on my shoulder, the effect was to twist me around, like some sort of clumsy dance partner.</p>
<p>"You already know Dolph, and you've met Grizz. You’ll be meetin’ a lotta solid guys over the next three days. The boys'll start rollin' in by four or so. This place'll be hoppin' t'night through the weekend. We're feedin' the whole club here tonight. Yogi, Wrench and Slim are out on the lake right now trollin' for Kokanee. Gonna have a hell of salmon feed."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0081" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Grizz’s grin had frozen. For a second, he just blinked at us, then his eyes hardened to a glare. He looked away and leaned back in his chair to respond to Vince.</p>
<p>“Yeah, we been gettin’ acquainted.” He shifted, sat up straighter, eyes flicking between me and Vince. “Looks like Karl already knows his way around better'n I figured.”</p>
<p>I caught a flicker of a grin from Dolph—just a glance aimed squarely at Grizz and then to me. He went back to his notepad.</p>
<p>Grizz didn’t notice. Just scratched the back of his neck and turned to stare off into the cardroom as if watching out for intruders. I figured I just got branded as the intruder.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0085" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I startled when another arm dropped across my shoulders from the other side—Chris. A breath later—fear—can’t have them so close to me in front of strangers. What if it made me...too late. My dick pushed against my left leg.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0086" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Gotta hide that—I pulled away, turning to face them—shielding my bulging pants from Grizz and Dolph.</p>
<p>Just like last weekend, challenges came fast and furious on the west side of the mountains.</p>
<p>"Hey, Chris." He seemed surprised I bolted, but I watched his eyes drag down my body to my uncomfortably constrained hardon. He smirked.</p>
<p>Vince stepped over to the table to speak with Dolph.</p>
<p>Chris smiled wickedly at me. "Good ride from the eastside this morning?"</p>
<p>I explained the incident with the car broadside on the highway.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0092" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Sounds like you've got that bike properly under you.” He laughed. “Bet you rode every day since we left, didn't ya?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0093" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I grinned. "Yeah, every day, and pretty much all day. There's this road on the Rez called Mollies Nipple—gravel—follows Birch Creek in this twisty little canyon. It goes through the middle of one of those Hutterite colonies. It's kick ass fun."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0094" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris nodded and smiled, but then switched right over to being my boss. "We got paperwork to do and get you settled into a room next door. Let's do that first." He turned and walked to the same side door where we stashed the Honda last week.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Motel1">Motel 1</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0097" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The side exit from the card room faced a rundown strip of a motel. The rooms, about ten of them in a line, looked increasingly derelict from the left at the road to the right by the railroad tracks. The last three rooms had plywood nailed over the windows. The wood shingle siding, a filthy pastel coral, pegged the last paint job to the 1960s. The crumbling concrete foundations revealed a recently torn down drive through awning by the front office.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0098" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Looking at the building's position near the old Great Northern Truck shop and the railroad tracks I could guess the prehistory. It had likely been overnight quarters for railroad workers, probably as far back into the steam era.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0099" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris turned and spoke over his right shoulder to me. "You're gonna be in the leftmost room, it's the most done. Bring the bike over and get unloaded. Leave it over here, the lot's gonna be full before this evening."</p>
<p>I walked around to the Horse's front door. Chris and Vince had parked their choppers on either side of the Ironhead—just like they flanked me in the cardroom a few minutes ago—some sort of statement? I pulled the bike out from between the choppers and rolled over to my weekend digs. Chris stood by the open door.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0101" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I didn't have much to unload, just backpack of clothes in the right saddle bag. I had included a couple books and my current electronics project. There will be down time and I'm not gonna want a crowd.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0102" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I carried my pack and bags from the bike to the doorway. "So, are you Snake?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0103" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah. That my club name. Used to be 'Snake Eyes.'  Got shortened over the years."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0104" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He saw me shake my head. "Traditional thing to do, all the MCs do it. Everybody gets name. You're not in the club, but I suspect you'll get a name before the day ends. You're gonna be dealing for a lot club guys this evening."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0105" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We stepped into the unfinished room. Only the walls adjacent to the neighboring unit had drywall. The bathroom walls were just studs displaying the sink, toilet and shower stall to the rest of the room. I surmised by the random scattering of the rugs, they covered flaws in the obviously new concrete floor—a bed, an alarm clock, couple lamps, a table, a chair and a desk.</p>
<p>I set my pack and bags on the floor near the desk. Chris had his hand on my crotch before he even had the door shut. My dick reacted as Chris obviously expected.</p>
<p>"You wanna fuck your boss?"</p>
<p>I just looked at him. I didn't know what to say, while every nerve in my body shouted, "yeah, let's fuck now."</p>
<p>Chris started to tug on my belt.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0110" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Wait. Umm." Was it okay to have sex with Chris when Vince wasn't there? Do I ask him that question or is it supposed to be obvious? "Vince isn't here," I stammered out.</p>
<p>Chris looked at me puzzled. "...So?"</p>
<p>"uhh, I mean, is it ok with him? I don't know how this works."</p>
<p>"You're fine—don't need a permission slip."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0114" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Umm, yeah. Listen, I need a break. Too much already today. I don’t wanna burn out like last weekend."</p>
<p>He didn't respond for a moment. "Bet you've never had slow relaxing sex, have ya? That's ok, there'll be plenty of time."</p>
<p>He stepped to the door, pulled it open before turning back to me. "Come over to the office behind the bar in about a half hour. We got paperwork to do. You unwind." Then his expression changed to wolfish grin. "We'll fuck later when I've got you on the clock." He shut the door behind him.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Motel2">Motel 2</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0119" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I sat at the desk in my motel room trying to compose myself. I valued silence and solitude. I’m walking way from that for money.</p>
<p>I had my electronics project spread out as I started soldering... A knock on my door broke my concentration. I scowled and opened the door.</p>
<p>Sarah stood there on a mission.</p>
<p>“Karl. We need to talk.” She looked around, then pushed past me with a flat, “May I come in,” but not as a question.</p>
<p>"Sure." I felt my brow furrow as she pushed by me.</p>
<p>She surveyed the room. "Goddamn, they haven't even finished the drywall in here." She looked around. "They only gave you one chair?”</p>
<p>She sat on the edge of the bed and gestured to my chair at the desk. She looked at me for a moment as if trying to read me. "I'll be blunt. What's your angle?"</p>
<p>I just looked at her in confusion.</p>
<p>Her expression turned into a glare. "I don’t buy that wide-eyed act from last weekend. If you can bluff a card table half as good as Chris says, I don’t see why you wouldn’t try bluffin’ me now. You're after something here. What is it?"</p>
<p>"I'm, uh, sorry. I need the job."</p>
<p>"No, it's more than that. Vince and Chris turn tricks all the time. They never bring their boys into our house and they never see ‘em more than once."</p>
<p>“Turn tricks? Whaddya mean?”</p>
<p>"Oh, come off it. Vince’s talkin’ about bendin’ club rules just to keep you close, and he’s already stuck you on a club bike like you earned it. And Chris? He’s struttin’ around grinnin’ like a kid with a double dip ice cream cone. This ain't normal. So what’s the play here, sweetheart?"</p>
<p>I sat there, gaping like a fool. “I don’t have a play. I don’t even know what this is.”</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes. “All right then—what’d they tell you?” She eye’d me hard enough to push me back against my seat.</p>
<p>“Said they need new blood in the club. They think I got skills nobody else’s got around here.”</p>
<p>Her eyes didn’t falter. “Poker we got. What I don’t get is why Vince thinks you’re some sort of missing piece.”</p>
<p>“I’m a computer programmer. Says he wants younger guys with new ideas.”</p>
<p>"Computer programmer?" Her skepticism felt like a slap. "You don't look the part. What makes you one?"</p>
<p>"I got a degree in it. Bachelor degree in Computer Science."</p>
<p>She nodded, still steeped in distrust. “Go on…”</p>
<p>“I programmed for that school records company in East Glacier until this spring. Didn't get along with Bill, the owner. I really wanna go on to grad school, masters. Don’t have the money… and what’s the point? I know what I am.  I’m illegal in this state. I’ll probably be dealing cards for the rest of my life, I might as well get started.”</p>
<p>I think I saw her eyes soften and then switch to calculating. She didn’t say anything, just looked at me.</p>
<p>I had to fill the silence. “Chris's job offer is the only thing I got. Now I’m… here.” I dropped my eyes to the floor.</p>
<p>She pursed her lips, stayed silent for a moment. “They should’ve told me more. But they didn’t. And that ain’t your fault.” She finally looked away from me. “Goddamn him, always playin’ savior." She looked back. "Does this with cats, too, y'know."</p>
<p>She looked hard at me for a full half minute, and then took a deep breath, held a moment, then let it out. "So you and Vince are tag-teamin' Chris, eh?"</p>
<p>I think my eyes widened for an instant because Sarah suddenly took on a satisfied smirk.</p>
<p>"I know you blow guys." She paused to see my reaction. "Do you take it up the ass?"</p>
<p>Another eye widening, this time with gritted teeth. "No..."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"...uh, it never occurred to me." I firmly shook my head.</p>
<p>She nodded to me and then leaned forward as if confiding in me. "Just so you know, Vince'll take it up the ass. You just gotta tell him you wanna to do it. He won't ask."</p>
<p>I sat there dumbfounded—no clue on how to respond. Is she setting me up or betraying Vince?</p>
<p>She pointed over my shoulder to the desk. "That thing you're working on. On the table. What is it? Looks like you're making your own telephone."</p>
<p>Just-like that first ride on the Sportster last week when I fumbled the clutch—I blinked a couple times and tried to catch up with Sarah.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0154" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pivoted in my chair and looked at the project. "It's just an electronics project." I had left the soldering iron on.</p>
<p>"Why do you have it here?"</p>
<p>"I'm not on shift all the time. I gotta have things to do."</p>
<p>"So what is it?"</p>
<p>"It's a Blue Box. I made it in college from parts at Radio Shack. It lets you make long distance calls without having to pay.”</p>
<p>Sarah was really good at skeptical looks, as if she thought I made it up.</p>
<p>“It tricks the AT&T long distance lines into not logging the call in the billing system."</p>
<p>She drew her head back and settled on incredulous. "Show me."</p>
<p>"I can't right now. I'm fixing the wires on the battery case. Then I gotta buy some batteries. I can do that after I get cash for the poker shifts."</p>
<p>She smiled broadly at me, first time it seemed like she approved of me. "I think we can find you some batteries. Tell me how it works.”</p>
<p>“The exploit hinges on in-band control signals. When you’re on a call, you can make sounds that’ll cause the phone system do things. This device makes the phone system hang up the other end of the call, but not your end. You’re just sitting there connected to a long distance line that thinks it’s available to use. So dial a number, it’ll connect: no record, no billing, no trace.”</p>
<p>“Okay, what’s the catch?”</p>
<p>“The phone company is onto it. You can’t fool their newer equipment. It stopped working in Missoula a couple years ago. It still works where I live on the Rez. I wanna see if it works here.”</p>
<p>She nodded at me. “I do all the book keeping for the bar and the club. I got twenty-seven employees. I do the payroll, track inventory and do budgeting. What computer could—“</p>
<p>“IBM XT, Peachtree Accounting seems to be the popular choice. IBM’s gonna have a new machine out some time soon.”</p>
<p>She sat up straight and put her hands in her lap. "Think I get what Vince is doin’.” She leveled her eye at me. “Here's the deal. You ain't gonna pay for graduate school slingin' cards a few night a week. You keep dealin' for Chris, fine—but when you're not in the box, you work for me. You're gonna computerize our books." She paused and raised a wry smile. "Can think of other uses for you, too."</p>
<p>“I’d love to help you get you books onto the computer. Do you have one? What kind?”</p>
<p>“No, we gotta buy one. You can help us with that, too.”</p>
<p>My grin grew and my expectations flipped from resignation to excitement. Screw the card dealing, I wanted to talk about computers.</p>

<h2 id="IronHorse">Iron Horse</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0175" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I walked into the bar through the front door, still a couple hours from opening, eyes taking too long to adjust to the lower light level. Dolph stood behind the bar. One of the other bartenders, a guy in his late thirties, big mustache, no beard, bit of a paunch, wearing a black T-shirt tagged with “Whiskey” across the chest. Appropriately, he pulled bottles of Jack Daniels from under the bar while Dolph held a clipboard.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0176" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I didn’t see Chris, so I headed toward the dogleg corridor to the card room behind the bar.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0177" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince's angry voice from the open door of the office startled me.  He sounded furious. “What the fuck do you think I’m paying you for?” A moment silence then a crash—Vince's fist on the desk.  “Say it! Tell me right now. What I’m paying you to do?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0178" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I darted by the open door, not looking in, grateful his focus was not on me. I rushed the five strides into the card room, nearly colliding with Chris coming the other way.</p>
<p>He grabbed my both my shoulders as we maneuvered to avoid the crash. "Ah, great, you're. Let's get some papers signed in the office. Then I'll walk you through the routines and the rules in the card room."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0180" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I winced as I heard more of Vince's shouting. "You’re takin’ this purchase order to the warehouse in Missoula. You’re bringin’ back the whole goddamn order of Jack. Go. Now!"</p>
<p>Just as we approached the office door, Grizz rushed out and headed toward the bar. I doubt he even saw us.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0182" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris whipped into the office. Apprehensive of Vince’s anger, lagging behind seemed the wise course, I stopped just inside the doorway.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0183" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The office had three desks and housed the backside of the cashier window for the card room. Vince stood at his desk, the one deepest into the room. He gave me a big smile when he saw me in the doorway.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0184" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I marveled how he could change his affect in just a few seconds.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0185" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris’s strode straight to the desk on the left grabbing a clipboard and turned toward Vince gesturing with his right hand, fingers and thumb rubbing one another.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0186" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince looked down, flashed a quick grin and nodded. He grabbed a pen from his desk and tore a sheet off a notepad. He wrote for a moment, folded the paper in half and handed it to Chris. Vince grinned at me again and gave a nod.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0187" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I still waited by the doorway as Chris gestured me back into the hallway. I stepped backward. He whipped by me to the door across the hall, unlocking and opening it one smooth practiced motion.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0188" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“We’ll talk in the apartment. Quieter there.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0189" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He flipped on a light switch. The fluorescent tubes flickered then revealed a hallway, perpendicular to the first, having one door to the left, another the right and, at the end, a heavier door to the outside.  An exit behind a locked door with no illuminated exit sign—not fire code compliant.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0190" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He opened the door to the right and went in. Before I followed along, I looked at the door to the left. If my mental map of the building was correct, that would open into the fourth garage bay. Felt odd, like Chris led me the wrong way. I shook it off.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0191" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The room Chris actually led me to, surprised me—a fully furnished one room apartment. It had a kitchen, bathroom, washer and drier, a table large enough for six, couch, television and a bed.  I updated my mental map of the building. The kitchen and bathroom line up the back side of the bar's restrooms. Then imagining the rest of the building, I realized the bar's sinks rode that same line. Clever plumbing, just one wet wall in the design.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0192" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris sat down at the table with the clipboard, gestured me to join him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0193" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Over the next twenty minutes he reviewed procedures for checking in at the beginning of the shift, the cash out procedures, and all the minutia of being an employee of the bar.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0194" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I signed the final document.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0195" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Congratulations, you’re officially my employee and on the clock. This is for you.” He handed me a package containing two black tank top t-shirts.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0196" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pulled one out and unfolded it. It said “Two Braids” and “Dealer” in white lettering.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0197" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Two Braids? That’s what some of the students on the Rez called me.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0198" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Not surprising. Not many guys around with braids in his beard, let alone two of ‘em.  I told you you’d have nickname before end of the day.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0199" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“I kinda hoped to make my own.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0200" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“That’s not the way nicknames work around here. No body gets to choose their own.” He smiled at me. “Hey, did you bring that earring like I asked you to?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0201" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Yeah. It’s in the motel room.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0202" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Make it part of your get up. If you're in the bar with the tank top on, you wear the earring, too. Your image is as important as your dealing skills. The tourists might not trust you, but they'll love to take the story home that they played poker at a biker bar. Like Vince said, it's a show.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0203" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We sat in silence for a moment, when Chris suddenly said, “Oh, I nearly forgot. This is for you.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0204" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He placed Vince’s folded paper on the table, put his finger on it, and slid over in front of me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0205" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I picked it up, unfolded it, reading Vince’s words: “He’ll stop running his mouth if you fuck him. Make him shut up.” Followed by his unreadable signature.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0206" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I laughed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0207" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris leered at me, his wicked grin blossoming. “You’re always supposed to do what the club president says." He looked to the clock on the wall. "We’ve got about forty minutes.” He gestured to the bed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0208" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My body took over, my mind just hung on for the ride.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0209" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Lying on my back, he fucked himself with my dick. He took charge of every move our coupled bodies made. He controlled me with his ass. He could actually take me to the edge of coming, drag me back, and then build me up again—so grateful to him for giving me a full on experience of sexual ecstasy.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0210" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He was right, relaxed fucking is just as good as the frenetic stuff.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="IronHorse-CardRoom">Iron Horse - Card Room</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0213" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>How could I not just power into the rest of the day feeling like a titan? Everything looked good to me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0214" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We walked back to the card room about five minutes late for, what I learned, was the All Dealer's meeting. Apparently, a traditional meeting at the beginning of the Sturgis season.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0215" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris opened it up. "Hey everyone. Thank for coming in early today. It's gonna be a big weekend and we're all gonna make a lot of money."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0216" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"We got a new dealer today. This is Two Braids from over the mountains on the Blackfeet Rez."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0217" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I whipped my head around to look at Chris. That just didn't sound right—I wasn't a tribe member.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0218" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris moved on without noticing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0219" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"This weekend is the mid-summer run of the Bitterroot Bastards. They'll start arriving this afternoon round four. At six, all employees are invited to join the Bastards for barbecue salmon on the back patio.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0220" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Murmurs of appreciation came from the assembled dealers.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0221" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris talked for twenty minutes. I realized this was more of a pep rally than a staff meeting. He did talk about special security measures for the weekend.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0222" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As everyone dispersed, he called out to one of them. “Lonna, I want you to be Two Braid’s guide. Show him all the table procedures. Walk him through checking out his tokes, signaling, everything."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0223" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The woman that separated from the rest of the dealers and came over had tits so large that I blinked—not sure they were real. As she approached, I had to drag my eyes up to her face, but they kept dropped back down—awkward as all hell. I was the last person they were aimed at, but even I couldn't easily look elsewhere.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0224" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris stayed long enough to introduce us and then retreated back to the office between the cardroom and the bar.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0225" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She stepped up to me and we shook hands. "Ah, you're the one that Sarah told me about. Never known a guy in our line of work."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0226" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>No idea what she meant—most of the dealers were guys—I just nodded and smiled.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0227" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"We got our own meeting in about twenty minutes. We're gonna talk about what happened last weekend with Linda. Sarah tell you to come to?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0228" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I hesitated. "No, Sarah didn't mention anything to me." I got the feeling I missed something important here.</p>
