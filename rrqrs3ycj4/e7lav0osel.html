            <h2 id="GoatLick,Montana">Goat Lick, Montana</h2>
<p>US2 westbound—I stood on the edge of the highway overlooking Goat Lick.  I gazed down at a great bend of the Middle Fork of the Flathead. So eager to eat the mountainside, it ripped out a quarter mile of riverbank.  A thousand vertical feet mountain slumped, a gaping wound, a strangely white talus slope with reddish stains streaking down to the whitewater river.</p>
<p>As if defying the peril of the crumbling cliff, a BN freight train crawled a perfectly straight line drawn across the blanched gravel. I couldn't drag my eyes away from the juxtaposition of engineering and raw unstable geology.</p>
<p>I scanned briefly for mountain goats. I didn't see any.  Even a snowfield wouldn't be a better camouflage.</p>
<p>This was my first time stopping here. There really wasn't any sort of proper pullout for people wanting the view. Fortunately, the bike didn't take up much room on the shoulder.</p>
<p>I watched the train until the end, noting yet another with no caboose. Is it finally the end of that era?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="HungryHorse,Montana">Hungry Horse, Montana</h2>
<p>I passed through West Glacier, and prepared for the speed-up slow-down routine of the next twelve miles—four small towns in rapid succession, each with town speed limits and very short full speed highway sections between them. I needed to pass several cars to get myself in the best position for the curves in Badrock Canyon. I didn't want anyone in front of me so I could take the curves at my own speed.</p>
<p>I passed an eighteen wheeler between Belton and Corum. Got around another couple cars between Corum and Martin City. Hungry Horse—speed down to thirty-five, the biggest of the towns, I prayed nobody would pull into that clear highway ahead.</p>
<p>No such luck. A local's pickup pulled in just before the bridge over the Flathead river. The other side, the speed limit went back to fifty-five and the curves began. Half way across the bridge, the truck's left turn signal came on. My heart leapt—they were going to take the fishing access road.</p>
<p>Moments later I had my clear lane ahead of me. I accelerated.</p>
<p>One car the shoulder ahead—flashing hazards. I moved to the left side of my lane to fly by them to the start the first curve.</p>
<p>Suddenly—the car moved—turned broadside across my lane—a fucking U-turn.</p>
<p>Hard on the rear brake—just a split second—off the throttle. Dump speed fast—off the brake—like my heart collided with my ribs. Counter steer left—lean hard right, take the bike with me. Riding the sidewall, the right foot peg scraped over the fog line. Yank the bike back upright. Counter steer right—lean hard left—front tire chirped, but held.</p>
<p>Holy shit, holy shit.</p>
<p>Now flying upright along the shoulder—slicing the car's late morning shadow—eyes on the car’s rear bumper—left foot peg, six  inch clearance—orange license plate—Reagan/Bush bumper sticker.</p>
<p>Breathe dammit, breathe.</p>
<p>Kicking up gravel behind. Wood debris ahead. Quick reverse it—lean hard left and snap right—back in the travel lane, upright—guard rail banking left dead ahead—lean left into the first curve of Badrock Canyon. Roll the throttle out of the curve. Goddamn—the torque of this machine—no need to downshift.</p>
<p>Too late to look in the mirror—nothing to see but the river beyond the turning asphalt.</p>
<p>I swallowed hard. Focus on staying alive—taking each curve as it presented itself. Took only a moment to glance up at that one cliff outcrop that juts out over the highway—gonna fall someday.</p>
<p>A dozen tight curves behind me, I streaked out of Badrock Canyon, a mile before the turn into Columbia Falls.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="TheIronHorse">The Iron Horse</h2>
<p>Ten minutes later, I coasted into the Horse's empty parking lot with my heart still pounding against my ribs. I swung the bike into the spot near the front door. Place looked closed—nobody around. I just sat there with my boots firmly planted on the ground, reliving that swerve around the idiot in the Chevy. I could still see him, head turned the wrong way—never even knew I was there.</p>
<p>"You Karl?"</p>
<p>I jerked in surprise having neither seen nor heard the guy step up. My ears still rang from the wind noise. "Yeah."</p>
<p>"Chris said you might roll in early. C’mon ‘round back—no sense bakin’ out here in the sun. Name’s Grizz."</p>
<p>The name fit—big burly guy with a fierce wide reddish beard, probably about 30.</p>
<p>He stopped, taking a closer look at me. "Something happen?" He said to me with his head slightly cocked to the side.</p>
<p>My head turned back forward on the bike and saw both my hands, white knuckles still on the bars. I let out a long breath and let go. "Some ass in a Chevy pulled a fucking U-turn from the shoulder right in front of me. Missed by inches. I was doin’ sixty just this side of Hungry Horse before Bad Rock.”</p>
<p>"What was it—clueless Iowa flatlander or a rez buck with a baling wire  bumper?"</p>
<p>I hesitated, thinking of the driver’s turned head. "Never saw his face.  Orange plate, though. Don't know what state's orange..."</p>
<p>I shoved the side stand down, leaned the bike onto it, and dismounted.</p>
<p>Grizz towered over me.  He offered his hand—we clasped wrists.  He turned to walk away. "C'mon around to the shade, we've got the patio open."</p>
<p>I followed him around the side of the building and then around to the back. The mainline of the BN paralleled the building with a gap about the width of US2. Was the Horse's brick building an old truck engine shop for the Great Northern? The Horse had four garage doors tall enough for big rigs facing the tracks, the second from the right open revealing the card room. A couple tables sat on the apron in front of the gaping door.</p>
<p>I smiled as I saw Dolph sitting at a table facing me.</p>
<p>"Howdy, Dolph. Nice to see you again." He looked from a notepad and nodded his silent greeting with a hint of a smile.</p>
<p>Griz and I sat down at the table. Dolph went right back to writing on his notepad.</p>
<p>"So uh… what makes you so special? Chris says the whole club supposed to get to know you or somethin’."</p>
<p>"Whaddaya mean?" I didn't know anything about this.</p>
<p>I caught Dolf closing his notepad and frowning at Grizz just as a low pulsing rumble started to vibrate the air. A gang of Burlington Northern SD40-2 approaching.</p>
<p>Grizz also noticed Dolf's frown and backed down. "Not sayin’ nothin’ bad, I’m just askin’. That’s all." He pasted an obviously fake smile on his face and looked back to me.</p>
<p>"I don't know anything about what Chris said, let alone why he said it. It's news to me. I'm just a card dealer."</p>
<p>The train’s turbo whine spooled up as the accelerated on the stretch of track out of Bad Rock Canyon straight to Whitefish. I got up and walked toward the tracks, forgetting all about Grizz and Dolph in my eagerness to stand near the tracks. No fence divided the right of way from the concrete. I loved the way the rumble vibrated my chest.</p>
<p>I stood there for the whole train length to pass. This was the same one that I saw crossing the cliff at Goat Lick. I wandered back to the table without explaining myself.</p>
<p>"Where'd you ride in from?" He looked at me skeptically and I started to feel really wary of him.</p>
<p>"I live on the Blackfeet Rez near East Glacier."</p>
<p>"Dealing on the rez? Huh. That new, or just under the table like everything else over there?"</p>
<p>"No, there's no card rooms. I was teaching at the tribal college."</p>
<p>"Teachin'? Why do the injuns need to learn to deal cards? That's all we need a bunch of bucks at the card tables."</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ, no." I flinched at his word "bucks"—like the men of the tribes didn't even qualify as people. "I taught computer programming."</p>
<p>He stared at me for an awkward moment. "Computers? Figures." He turned to Dolph. "We lettin’ the scrawny nerds run the poker tables now?"</p>
<p>This was a goddamn test—he's baiting me. I glanced over at Dolph. He just looked at me as if waiting to see my reaction. Is everyone gonna be testing me today?</p>
<p>I can't start off my first day making enemies. I gotta turn this guy around and make him like me.</p>
<p>I smiled at him and nodded. "Yup, I'm a bona fide nerd, but I'm a nerd on a bike that can dodge a flatlander broadside across the highway, then tear through Bad Rock at sixty without missing a beat."</p>
<p>I looked over at Dolph and then back to Grizz. "Since you’re hanging here with Dolph, I'm guessing you're one of the bouncers—I'm gonna rely on you to protect my nimble fingers, the cards, and my toke box. I look forward to seeing you in action. What's the worst you've seen? Does it get bad here?"</p>
<p>Grizz flashed genuine grin. "Coupla weeks ago, these college kids stumble outta the bar. I'm watchin' from the lot, just lettin' 'em clear out. One of 'em—tall shit in a MSU Bobcat t-shirt—gets this genius idea to jump onto Vince's chopper.” He leaned toward me, like he decided to speak in confidence. “That’s the club president’s bike. You’ll probably meet him today."</p>
<p>His voice got excited, enjoying the climax of his story. "Didn't shout. Didn't warn. I walk over, grab him by the collar, and bounce his head off the asphalt—twice, just to be sure he remembers. His buddies step up and I decked 'em before they even knew what happened. They limped outta lot all quiet with piss in their pants."</p>
<p>I nodded and smiled, doing my best to look impressed.</p>
<p>“Nobody touches Vince’s scoot. Not on my watch.” Grizz returned the smile. “Vince is a great guy. You always show him respect. He’s the boss. Do what he says.”</p>
<p>I thought about Vince and me swapping blowjobs last weekend.</p>
<p>Grizz had no clue how well I already knew the president—I nodded to him, accepting his advice.</p>
<p>A new rumble rolled in—deep, familiar, not a train this time. Harleys. Choppers.</p>
<p>I grinned. "That’s Vince and Chris now. Doesn’t sound like he’s fixed that pushrod issue yet." I looked directly at Grizz.</p>
<p>Dolph closed his notepad. "Yup. Been doin' that since last Summer."</p>
<p>Grizz gave me a puzzled look. I could see the question cross his mind: "How could this nerdy little fucker know anything about the lifters in Vince's bike."</p>
<p>About two minutes later, Vince strode into the cardroom through the door to the bar, heading straight for our table just outside in the shade. He didn’t even glance at the others. Just came straight toward me.</p>
<p>"Karl! Buddy—glad you’re joinin’ the crew today. Gonna be a hell of a good weekend."</p>
<p>I stood up, stepped toward Vince with my hand out. Instead reaching for my handshake, he pulled me into a fraternal bear hug, slapping me on the back a couple times. He released the hug, and turned to face the table, with his arm still on my shoulder.</p>
<p>"You already know Dolph, and you've met Grizz. You’ll be meetin’ a lotta solid guys over the next three days."</p>
<p>Grizz’s grin froze. For a second, he just blinked at us, like he realized he had missed an important point. Then he chuckled—forced, flat—and leaned back in his chair.</p>
<p>“Yeah, we been gettin’ acquainted” He shifted, sitting up a little straighter. “Guess Karl knows his way around already.”</p>
<p>I caught a flicker of a grin from Dolph—just a glance aimed squarely at Grizz and then to me, with a subtle nod.</p>
<p>Grizz didn’t even look. Just scratched the back of his neck and stared off into the cardroom like he’d knew he’d been conned.</p>
<p>Another arm went across my shoulders from the other side. Chris surprised me and then—fear—I couldn't have them so close to me in front of strangers. What if it made me...too late. My dick pushed down the left leg, and I stood facing Grizz. I wanted out immediately.</p>
<p>I pulled away from their arms, turning my body around to face them—turning my bulging pants away from Grizz and Dolph. Just like last weekend, challenges came fast and furious on the east side of the mountains.</p>
<p>"Hey, Chris." He seemed surprised I bolted, but I watched his eyes drag down my body to my uncomfortably compressed hardon. He smirked.</p>
<p>Vince walked on to the table to speak with Dolph.</p>
<p>"How was your ride here this morning? Bet it was nice."</p>
<p>"Almost killed outside of Hungry Horse with a tourist broadside across the highway."</p>
<p>"Jesus—glad you're still here buddy. Tell me about it."</p>
<p>I explained the near accident.</p>
<p>"Sounds like you've got that bike properly under you. Bet you rode every single day since we left."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I did."</p>
<p>Chris switched to business mode. "We got paperwork to do and get you settled into a room nextdoor. Let's do that first." He turned and walked to the same side door where we stashed my Honda last weekend.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Motel1">Motel 1</h2>
<p>The side exit from the card room faced a rundown strip of a motel, with a sagging drive through awning. The rooms, about ten of them in a line, looked increasingly derelict from the left by the road to the right by the railroad tracks. The last three rooms had plywood nailed over the windows.</p>
<p>Chris turn and spoke over his right shoulder to me. "You're gonna be in the leftmost room, it's the most complete. Bring your bike over and get unloaded. Leave the bike over here, the lot's gonna be full before this evening."</p>
<p>Walked around to the Horse's front door. Chris and Vince had parked their choppers on either side of the Ironhead—just like they flanked me in the cardroom a few minutes ago—some sort of statement? I pulled the bike out from between the choppers and rolled over to my weekend digs. Chris stood by the open door.</p>
<p>I didn't have much to unload, backpack of clothes in the right bag. I had included a couple books and my current electronics project. There will be down time and I'm not gonna want a crowd.</p>
<p>The room was unfinished. Only the walls adjacent to the neighboring unit had drywall. The bathroom walls were just studs showing the sink, a toilet and a shower stall. I surmised by the random scattering of the rugs, they cover flaws in the obviously new concrete floor—a bed, an red lit digital alarm clock, couple lamps, a table, a chair and a desk.</p>
<p>I set my pack and bags on the floor near the desk. Chris had his hand on my crotch before he even had the door shut. My dick reacted as Chris obviously expected.</p>
<p>"You wanna fuck your boss?"</p>
<p>I just looked at him. I didn't know what to say, while every nerve in my body shouted, "yeah, let's fuck now."</p>
<p>Chris started to tug on my belt.</p>
<p>"Wait. Umm." Was it okay to have sex with Chris when Vince wasn't there? Do I ask him that question or is it supposed to be obvious? "Vince isn't here." I stammered it out.</p>
<p>Chris looked at me puzzled. "...So?"</p>
<p>"uhh, I mean, is it ok with him? I don't know how this works."</p>
<p>"You're fine—don't need a permission slip."</p>
<p>"Umm, yeah, I'd love to, but I need a break. Too much already today. I don’t wanna burn out like last weekend."</p>
<p>He didn't respond for a moment. "Bet you've never had slow relaxing sex, have ya? That's ok, there'll be plenty of time later."</p>
<p>He stepped to the door, pulled it open before turning back to me. "Come over to the office behind the bar in about a half hour. We got paperwork to do." Then his expression changed to wolfish grin. "We'll fuck later when I've got you on the clock." He shut the door behind him.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Motel2">Motel 2</h2>
<p>I sat at the deck in my motel room trying to compose myself. All of these new people—this whole scene—</p>
<p>I had my electronics project spread out as I started soldering... A knock on my door broke my concentration. I scowled and opened the door. Sarah stood there looking determined.</p>
<p>“Karl. We need to talk.” She looked around, then pushed past me with a flat, “May I come in,” but not as a question.</p>
<p>"Sure." I felt my brow furrow as she pushed by me.</p>
<p>She surveyed the room. "Goddamn, they haven't even finished the drywall in here." She looked around. "They only gave you one chair?”</p>
<p>She sat on the edge of the bed and gestured me to sit in my chair at the desk. She looked at me for a moment as if trying to read me. "I'll be blunt. What's your angle?"</p>
<p>"Angle? I don't understand."</p>
<p>Her expression turned into a glare. "I don’t buy that wide-eyed act from last weekend. If you can bluff a card table half as good as Chris says, I don’t see why you wouldn’t try bluffin’ me now. You're after something here. What is it?"</p>
<p>"I'm, uh, sorry. I need the job."</p>
<p>"No, it's more than that. Vince and Chris turn tricks all the time. They never bring their boys into our house and they never see ‘em more than once."</p>
<p>“Turn tricks? Whaddya mean?”</p>
<p>"Oh, come off it. Vince’s talkin’ about bendin’ club rules just to keep you close, and he’s already stuck you on a club bike like you earned it. And Chris? He’s struttin’ around grinnin’ like a kid with a double dip ice cream cone. This ain't normal. So what’s the play here, sweetheart?"</p>
<p>I sat there mutely staring at her—deer in the headlights. "I don’t know. Get them to tell you, this all seems to be their idea. Will they give you the same story they gave me?”</p>
<p>“Whadda they tell you?” She eye’d me hard enough to push me back against my seat.</p>
<p>“Said they need new blood in the club. They think I got skills nobody else’s got around here.”</p>
<p>Her eyes didn’t falter. “Poker we got. What I don’t get is why Vince thinks you’re some sort of missing piece.”</p>
<p>“I’m a computer programmer. Says he wants younger guys with new ideas.”</p>
<p>She nodded, eyeing me with distrust. “Go on…”</p>
<p>“I really wanna go to grad school. Don’t have the money… and what’s the point? Who’s gonna hire a faggot programmer? I’ll probably be dealing cards for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p>I think I saw her eyes soften and then switch to calculating. She didn’t say anything, just looked at me.</p>
<p>I had to fill the silence. “I just learned ride three months ago. Suddenly I’m on a club bike and I’m to dealin’ cards at your bar. I bit Vince’s fishhook, they’ve reeled me in. Now I’m… here. The only thing I understand is that I’ve got no other options…” I dropped my eyes to the floor.</p>
<p>She pursed her lips, stayed silent for a moment. “They should’ve told me more. But they didn’t. And that ain’t your fault. Think I get what Vince is doin’” She finally looked away from me. “Goddamn him, so fuckin’ full of himself.”</p>
<p>She drew her focus back to me. "So you and Vince are tag-teamin' Chris, eh?"</p>
<p>I think my eyes widened for an instant because Sarah suddenly took on a satisfied smirk.</p>
<p>"I know you blow guys." She paused to see my reaction. "Do you take it up the ass?"</p>
<p>Another eye widening, this time with gritted teeth. "No..."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"...it never occurred to me." I firmly shook my head.</p>
<p>She nodded to me and then leaned forward as if confiding in me. "Just so you know, Vince'll take it up the ass. You just gotta tell you want to do it. He won't ask for it."</p>
<p>I sat there dumbfounded—no clue on how to respond. Is she setting me up or betraying Vince?</p>
<p>She pointed over my shoulder to the desk. "That thing you're working on. On the table. What is it? Looks like you're making your own telephone."</p>
<p>It’s was like that first ride last week on the Sportster when I couldn’t find the right gear and flailed for a moment on the clutch. I blinked a couple times and tried to catch up with Sarah.</p>
<p>"This is my Blue Box. I made it in college from parts at Radio Shack. It lets you make long distance calls without having to pay. It tricks the AT&T long distance lines into not logging the call in the billing system."</p>
<p>She drew her head back and looked incredulous. "Show me."</p>
<p>"I can't right now. I'm fixing the wires on the battery case. Then I gotta buy some batteries. I can do that after I get paid for the poker shifts."</p>
<p>She smiled broadly at me, first time it seemed like she approved of me. "I think we can find you some batteries. Tell me how it works.”</p>
<p>“The exploit hinges on in-band control signals. When you’re on a call, you can make sounds that’ll cause the phone system do things. This device makes the phone system hang up the other end of the call, but not your end. You’re just sitting there connected to a long distance line that thinks it’s available to use. So dial a number, it’ll connect: no record, no billing, no trace. ”</p>
<p>“Okay, what’s the catch?”</p>
<p>“The phone company is onto it. You can’t fool their newer equipment. It stopped working in Missoula a couple years ago. It still works where I live on the Rez. I wanna see if it works here.”</p>
<p>“I saw Griz this morning, he asked I’d met the nerdy fucker Chris hired.“</p>
<p>She sat up straight and put her hands in her lap. "Here's the deal. You ain't gonna pay for graduate school slingin' cards a few night a week. You keep dealin' for Chris, fine—but when you're not in the box, you work for me. You’re gonna computerize the books. Get us outta the Stone Age..." She paused.  "...other projects will come up, too."</p>
<p>She smiled again as I assumed my eyes lit up.</p>
