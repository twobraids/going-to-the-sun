            <h2 id="GoatLick,Montana">Goat Lick, Montana</h2>
<p>US2 westbound—I stood on the edge of the highway overlooking Goat Lick—a gorge made by the Middle Fork of the Flathead. No riverbanks—just steep talus slopes of oddly white crumbling rock stained with rust red streaks pointing down into the whitewater river.</p>
<p>Across the the top of the largest mountainside scar, an improbable BN freight train crawled on level tracks. The juxtaposition of engineering and the raw unstable geology defied sense—didn't look real.</p>
<p>I had seen this flash by countless times—today I stopped to marvel at it. Without any sort of proper pullout for gawking, it felt dicey to stand sandwiched between full speed highway traffic and the ribbon of guard rail on a shoulder barely wide enough for the bike.</p>
<p>Didn't matter—I watched the train until the end. Another train without caboose. Has a railroad era really ended?</p>
<p>I remounted the bike—facing west on the eastbound shoulder—and took off, chasing and then pacing the train on the mountainside across the valley. Eventually, the valley widened and the railroad and highway chose diverging routes for a dozen miles. I pulled way in front and lost sight of the locomotives.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="HungryHorse,Montana">Hungry Horse, Montana</h2>
<p>I passed through West Glacier, and prepared for the speed-up slow-down routine of the next twelve miles—four small towns in rapid succession, each with town speed limits and very short full speed highway sections between them. I needed to pass several cars to get myself in the best position for the curves in Badrock Canyon. I didn't want anyone in front of me so I could take the curves at my own speed.</p>
<p>I passed an eighteen wheeler between Belton and Corum. Got around another couple cars between Corum and Martin City. Hungry Horse—speed down to thirty-five, the biggest of the towns, I prayed nobody would pull into that clear highway ahead.</p>
<p>No such luck. A local's pickup pulled in just before the bridge over the Flathead river. The other side, the speed limit went back to fifty-five and the curves began. Half way across the bridge, the truck's left turn signal came on. My heart leapt—they headed to the fishing access road.</p>
<p>Moments later I had my clear lane ahead of me. Satisfied grin—I accelerated, kicking it into fourth.</p>
<p>One car on the shoulder ahead—flashing hazards. I moved to the left toward the double yellow—set fly by them and into the lean for the first curve.</p>
<p>Suddenly—the car moved—turned broadside across my lane—a fucking U-turn.</p>
<p>Hard on the rear brake—just a split second—off the throttle. Dump speed fast—off the brake—like my heart collided with my ribs. Counter steer left—lean hard right, take the bike with me. Riding the sidewalls, the right foot peg scraped the fog line. Yank the bike back upright. Counter steer right—lean hard left—front tire chirped, but held.</p>
<p>Holy shit, holy shit.</p>
<p>Now flying upright along the shoulder—slicing the car's late morning shadow—eyes on the car’s rear bumper—left foot peg, inches of clearance—orange license plate—Reagan/Bush bumper sticker.</p>
<p>Kicking up gravel behind. Wood debris ahead. Quick reverse it—lean hard left and snap right—back in the travel lane, upright—guard rail banking left dead ahead—leaned left into the first curve of Badrock Canyon. Roll the throttle out of the curve. Goddamn—the torque of this machine—no need to downshift.</p>
<p>Too late to look in the mirror—nothing to see but the river beyond the curved asphalt. Breathe dammit, breathe.</p>
<p>I swallowed hard. Focus on staying alive—taking each curve as it presented itself. Took only a moment to glance up at that one cliff outcrop that juts out over the highway—gonna fall someday.</p>
<p>A dozen tight curves behind me, I streaked out of Badrock Canyon, a mile before the turn into Columbia Falls.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="TheIronHorse">The Iron Horse</h2>
<p>Ten minutes later, I coasted into the Horse's empty parking lot with my heart still pounding. I swung the bike into the spot near the front door. Place looked closed—nobody around. I just sat there with my boots firmly planted on the ground, reliving that swerve around the idiot in the Chevy. I could still see him, head turned the wrong way—never even knew I was there.</p>
<p>"You Karl?"</p>
<p>I jerked in surprise having neither seen nor heard the guy step up. My ears still rang from the wind noise. "Yeah."</p>
<p>"Snake said you might roll in early. C’mon ‘round back—no sense bakin’ out here in the sun. Name’s Grizz."</p>
<p>The name fit—big burly guy with a fierce wide reddish beard, probably about 30. Sounded like he said, "Snake"—didn't make sense.</p>
<p>He stopped, taking a closer look at me. "Something happen?" He asked with his head slightly cocked to the side.</p>
<p>My hands, white knuckles, still on the bars, like they had gotten stuck there. Heard my own breath let go. "Some ass in a Chevy pulled a fucking U-turn from the shoulder right in front of me. Missed by inches. I was doin’ sixty just this side of Hungry Horse before Bad Rock.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"What was it, clueless Iowa tourist or some rez buck runnin' a bumper tied with a baling wire?"</p>
<p>I hesitated, thinking of the driver’s turned head. "Never saw his face.  Orange plate, though. Don't know what state's orange..."</p>
<p>I shoved the side stand down, leaned the bike onto it, and dismounted.</p>
<p>Grizz towered over me.  He offered his hand—we clasped wrists.  He turned to walk away. "C'mon around to the shade, we've got the patio open."</p>
<p>I followed him along the west side of the building and then around to the back. The mainline of the BN paralleled the building with a gap about the width of US2. I got the impression that Horse's brick building formerly served as a truck engine shop for the old Great Northern Railroad.</p>
<p>The rear wall consisted of four garage doors tall enough for big rigs.  The second from the right stood open revealing the card room. I had to stand and look at for a minute. I'd swear that there were only three bay doors in the card room. A couple tables sat on the apron in front of the gaping door. What was behind door number four?</p>
<p>I smiled as I saw Dolph sitting at a table that had been dragged out from the card room. He looked up from a spiral bound notepad.</p>
<p>"Howdy, Dolph. Nice to see you again."</p>
<p>He nodded a silent greeting, then went straight back to his notepad.</p>
<p>Griz and I sat down at the table. He peered like he struggled to figure me out. "So uh… what makes you so special? Snake says the whole club supposed to get to know you or somethin’."</p>
<p>"Whaddaya mean?" I didn't know anything about this.</p>
<p>I spotted Dolph closing his notepad and frowning at Grizz.</p>
<p>A low slowly pulsing rumble started to vibrate the air. Train coming—that gang of Burlington Northern SD40s pulling a mile long string of grainers that I saw at Goat Lick.</p>
<p>Grizz noticed Dolph's frown and backed down. "Not sayin’ nothin’ bad, I’m just askin’. That’s all." He pasted an obviously fake smile on his face and looked back to me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I don't know anything about what Snake said, let alone why he said it, or even who the hell he is. It's news to me. I'm just a card dealer."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned toward the tracks, listening. Standing from my seat, I said, "Gimme a minute, I'm gonna checkout this train."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The train’s turbo whine spooled up as it accelerated west on the first straight run out of Bad Rock Canyon. Walked toward the tracks, forgetting all about Grizz and Dolph in my eagerness to stand on the right of way. No fence dividing the far side of bar's concrete patio expanse and the ballast of the tracks.</p>
<p>I waited for the first engine to thunder by and then stepped off the concrete onto the track ballast for the trailing power units—didn't want to alarm the engineer and conductor. I shut my eyes and reveled in the power of the diesels and the reverberation in my chest. Kinda like the bike, but deeper—stronger.</p>
<p>I stood there for the whole train to pass feeling the vibration, basking in the accompanying wind. I needed to get that car out of my head—replace the bad thrill with a good one.</p>
<p>As the last car glided by, I swung around to face the blinking red light and watched it recede toward Whitefish, that iron on iron squeal rapidly dropping in volume.</p>
<p>I wandered back to the table without explaining myself.</p>
<p>Grizz’s jaw hung slack, eyebrows pinched—he clearly thought I was nuts—not the first one coming to that conclusion.</p>
<p>I let him think about it then looked him straight in the eye. "It's a great rush. You oughta try it."</p>
<p>I caught that skeptical flicker in his eye. I went all in, daring him to call the hand I knew he couldn't beat.  "The real rush is climbing up under the tracks at end of a trestle.  You can lie down just under the ties. When the locomotives roll over, it's a rush like ya can't believe."</p>
<p>Griz shook his head. "Where'd you come from?"</p>
<p>"I live on the Blackfeet Rez near East Glacier."</p>
<p>He nodded as if I had just explained everything odd about me. "Dealing on the rez? Huh. That new, or under the table like everything over there?"</p>
<p>"No, of course not, there's no card rooms on the Rez. I was teaching at the tribal college."</p>
<p>He shot me another what-the-hell stare. "Teachin'? Why do the injuns need to learn to deal cards? That's all we need a bunch of bucks at the card tables."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0059" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>What the fuck? This guy got ahold of every wrong idea and ran with them.   "Jesus Christ, no." I shook my head at "bucks"—as if the men of the tribe didn't even qualify as people.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0060" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I taught computer programming."</p>
<p>He stared at me for an awkward moment. "Computers? Figures." He turned to Dolph. "We lettin’ the scrawny nerds run the poker tables now?"</p>
<p>This was a goddamn test—he's baiting me. I glanced over at Dolph. He just looked at me as if waiting to see my reaction. Has everyone gotta test me today?</p>
<p>Can't start off my first day making enemies. I gotta turn this guy around and make him like me.</p>
<p>Smile, nod—just agree with him. "Yup, I'm a bona fide nerd, but here today as a card dealer. They hired me to run a table, I'm here to do my job."</p>
<p>I looked over at Dolph and then back to Grizz. "Since you’re hanging here with Dolph, I'm guessing you're security, one of the bouncers—dealers like me rely on you guys. You protect me, the cards, and my toke box. What's the worst you've seen? Does it get bad here?"</p>
<p>Grizz's face lit up. "Coupla weeks ago, these college kids stumble outta the bar. I'm watchin' from the lot, just lettin' 'em clear out. One of 'em—tall shit in a MSU Bobcat t-shirt—gets this genius idea to jump onto Carnie's chopper, playin' like he's ridin'.” He leaned toward me, like he needed to clue me in. “That’s the club president’s bike. You’ll probably meet him today."</p>
<p>Carnie?</p>
<p>As his hand gestures got larger, he built up to the climax of his story. "Didn't shout. Didn't warn 'em. I walk over, grab him by the collar, and bounce his head off the asphalt—twice, just to be sure he remembers. His buddies step up and I decked 'em before they even knew what happened. They limped outta the lot fast with piss in their pants."</p>
<p>I nodded and smiled, doing my best to look impressed.</p>
<p>“Nobody touches Carnie’s scoot. Not on my watch.” Grizz returned my smile. “Carnie is a great guy. You always show him respect. He’s the boss. Ya gotta do what he says.”</p>
<p>It dawned on me—Carnie is Vince, duh. Could Snake be Chris?</p>
<p>I thought about Vince and me swapping blowjobs last weekend. Grizz had no clue how well I already knew the president—I nodded to him, accepting his advice.</p>
<p>A new rumble rolled in—deep and familiar, not a train this time. Harleys. Choppers.</p>
<p>I grinned. "That’s Vince and Chris now. Doesn’t sound like he’s fixed that pushrod issue yet." I looked directly at Grizz.</p>
<p>Dolph closed his notepad. "Yup. Doin' that since last Summer. Lifters been trouble since he built it."</p>
<p>Grizz gave me a puzzled look. I could see the question cross his mind—how's this nerdy little fucker know anything about the President's chopper?</p>
<p>I looked to Dolph. "So Carnie is Vince? That mean Chris is Snake?"</p>
<p>Dolph nodded to me silently.</p>
<p>About two minutes later, Vince strode into the cardroom through the door to the bar, heading straight for our table just outside in the shade. He didn’t even glance at the others. Just came straight to me.</p>
<p>"Karl! Buddy—glad you’re joinin’ the crew today. Gonna be a hell of a good weekend."</p>
<p>I stood up, stepped toward Vince with my hand out. Instead reaching for my handshake, he pulled me into a fraternal bear hug, slapping me on the back a couple times. He released the hug, and turned to face the table. With his arm still on my shoulder, the effect was to twist me around, like some sort of clumsy dance partner.</p>
<p>"You already know Dolph, and you've met Grizz. You’ll be meetin’ a lotta solid guys over the next three days. The boys'll start rollin' in by four or so. This place'll be hoppin' t'night through the weekend. We're feedin' the whole club here tonight. Yogi, Wrench and Slim are out on the lake right now trollin' for Kokanee. Gonna have a hell of salmon feed."</p>
<p>Grizz’s grin had frozen. For a second, he just blinked at us, then his eyes hardened to a glare. He looked away and leaned back in his chair to respond to Vince.</p>
<p>“Yeah, we been gettin’ acquainted.” He shifted, sat up straighter, eyes flicking between me and Vince. “Looks like Karl already knows his way around better'n I figured.”</p>
<p>I caught a flicker of a grin from Dolph—just a glance aimed squarely at Grizz and then to me. He went back to his notepad.</p>
<p>Grizz didn’t notice. Just scratched the back of his neck and turned to stare off into the cardroom as if watching out for intruders. I figured I just got branded as the intruder.</p>
<p>I startled when another arm dropped across my shoulders from the other side—Chris. A breath later—fear—can’t have them so close to me in front of strangers. What if it made me...too late. My dick pushed against my left leg.</p>
<p>Gotta hide that—I pulled away, turning to face them—shielding my bulging pants from Grizz and Dolph.</p>
<p>Just like last weekend, challenges came fast and furious on the west side of the mountains.</p>
<p>"Hey, Chris." He seemed surprised I bolted, but I watched his eyes drag down my body to my uncomfortably constrained hardon. He smirked.</p>
<p>Vince stepped over to the table to speak with Dolph.</p>
<p>Chris smiled wickedly at me. "Good ride from the eastside this morning?"</p>
<p>I explained the incident with the car broadside on the highway.</p>
<p>"Sounds like you've got that bike properly under you.” He laughed. “Bet you rode every day since we left, didn't ya?"</p>
<p>I grinned. "Yeah, every day, and pretty much all day. There's this road on the Rez called Mollies Nipple—gravel—follows Birch Creek in this twisty little canyon. It goes through the middle of one of those Hutterite colonies. It's kick ass fun."</p>
<p>Chris nodded and smiled, but then switched right over to being my boss. "We got paperwork to do and get you settled into a room next door. Let's do that first." He turned and walked to the same side door where we stashed the Honda last week.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Motel1">Motel 1</h2>
<p>The side exit from the card room faced a rundown strip of a motel. The rooms, about ten of them in a line, looked increasingly derelict from the left at the road to the right by the railroad tracks. The last three rooms had plywood nailed over the windows. The wood shingle siding, a filthy pastel coral, pegged the last paint job to the 1960s. The crumbling concrete foundations revealed a recently torn down drive through awning by the front office.</p>
<p>Looking at the building's position near the old Great Northern Truck shop and the railroad tracks I could guess the prehistory. It had likely been overnight quarters for railroad workers, probably as far back into the steam era.</p>
<p>Chris turned and spoke over his right shoulder to me. "You're gonna be in the leftmost room, it's the most done. Bring the bike over and get unloaded. Leave it over here, the lot's gonna be full before this evening."</p>
<p>I walked around to the Horse's front door. Chris and Vince had parked their choppers on either side of the Ironhead—just like they flanked me in the cardroom a few minutes ago—some sort of statement? I pulled the bike out from between the choppers and rolled over to my weekend digs. Chris stood by the open door.</p>
<p>I didn't have much to unload, just backpack of clothes in the right saddle bag. I had included a couple books and my current electronics project. There will be down time and I'm not gonna want a crowd.</p>
<p>I carried my pack and bags from the bike to the doorway. "So, are you Snake?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. That my club name. Used to be 'Snake Eyes.'  Got shortened over the years."</p>
<p>He saw me shake my head. "Traditional thing to do, all the MCs do it. Everybody gets name. You're not in the club, but I suspect you'll get a name before the day ends. You're gonna be dealing for a lot club guys this evening."</p>
<p>We stepped into the unfinished room. Only the walls adjacent to the neighboring unit had drywall. The bathroom walls were just studs displaying the sink, toilet and shower stall to the rest of the room. I surmised by the random scattering of the rugs, they covered flaws in the obviously new concrete floor—a bed, an alarm clock, couple lamps, a table, a chair and a desk.</p>
<p>I set my pack and bags on the floor near the desk. Chris had his hand on my crotch before he even had the door shut. My dick reacted as Chris obviously expected.</p>
<p>"You wanna fuck your boss?"</p>
<p>I just looked at him. I didn't know what to say, while every nerve in my body shouted, "yeah, let's fuck now."</p>
<p>Chris started to tug on my belt.</p>
<p>"Wait. Umm." Was it okay to have sex with Chris when Vince wasn't there? Do I ask him that question or is it supposed to be obvious? "Vince isn't here," I stammered out.</p>
<p>Chris looked at me puzzled. "...So?"</p>
<p>"uhh, I mean, is it ok with him? I don't know how this works."</p>
<p>"You're fine—don't need a permission slip."</p>
<p>"Umm, yeah. Listen, I need a break. Too much already today. I don’t wanna burn out like last weekend."</p>
<p>He didn't respond for a moment. "Bet you've never had slow relaxing sex, have ya? That's ok, there'll be plenty of time."</p>
<p>He stepped to the door, pulled it open before turning back to me. "Come over to the office behind the bar in about a half hour. We got paperwork to do. You unwind." Then his expression changed to wolfish grin. "We'll fuck later when I've got you on the clock." He shut the door behind him.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Motel2">Motel 2</h2>
<p>I sat at the desk in my motel room trying to compose myself. I valued silence and solitude. I’m walking way from that for money.</p>
<p>I had my electronics project spread out as I started soldering... A knock on my door broke my concentration. I scowled and opened the door.</p>
<p>Sarah stood there on a mission.</p>
<p>“Karl. We need to talk.” She looked around, then pushed past me with a flat, “May I come in,” but not as a question.</p>
<p>"Sure." I felt my brow furrow as she pushed by me.</p>
<p>She surveyed the room. "Goddamn, they haven't even finished the drywall in here." She looked around. "They only gave you one chair?”</p>
<p>She sat on the edge of the bed and gestured to my chair at the desk. She looked at me for a moment as if trying to read me. "I'll be blunt. What's your angle?"</p>
<p>I just looked at her in confusion.</p>
<p>Her expression turned into a glare. "I don’t buy that wide-eyed act from last weekend. If you can bluff a card table half as good as Chris says, I don’t see why you wouldn’t try bluffin’ me now. You're after something here. What is it?"</p>
<p>"I'm, uh, sorry. I need the job."</p>
<p>"No, it's more than that. Vince and Chris turn tricks all the time. They never bring their boys into our house and they never see ‘em more than once."</p>
<p>“Turn tricks? Whaddya mean?”</p>
<p>"Oh, come off it. Vince’s talkin’ about bendin’ club rules just to keep you close, and he’s already stuck you on a club bike like you earned it. And Chris? He’s struttin’ around grinnin’ like a kid with a double dip ice cream cone. This ain't normal. So what’s the play here, sweetheart?"</p>
<p>I sat there, gaping like a fool. “I don’t have a play. I don’t even know what this is.”</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes. “All right then—what’d they tell you?” She eye’d me hard enough to push me back against my seat.</p>
<p>“Said they need new blood in the club. They think I got skills nobody else’s got around here.”</p>
<p>Her eyes didn’t falter. “Poker we got. What I don’t get is why Vince thinks you’re some sort of missing piece.”</p>
<p>“I’m a computer programmer. Says he wants younger guys with new ideas.”</p>
<p>"Computer programmer?" Her skepticism felt like a slap. "You don't look the part. What makes you one?"</p>
<p>"I got a degree in it. Bachelor degree in Computer Science."</p>
<p>She nodded, still steeped in distrust. “Go on…”</p>
<p>“I programmed for that school records company in East Glacier until this spring. Didn't get along with Bill, the owner. I really wanna go on to grad school, masters. Don’t have the money… and what’s the point? I know what I am.  I’m illegal in this state. I’ll probably be dealing cards for the rest of my life, I might as well get started.”</p>
<p>I think I saw her eyes soften and then switch to calculating. She didn’t say anything, just looked at me.</p>
<p>I had to fill the silence. “Chris's job offer is the only thing I got. Now I’m… here.” I dropped my eyes to the floor.</p>
<p>She pursed her lips, stayed silent for a moment. “They should’ve told me more. But they didn’t. And that ain’t your fault.” She finally looked away from me. “Goddamn him, always playin’ savior." She looked back. "Does this with cats, too, y'know."</p>
<p>She looked hard at me for a full half minute, and then took a deep breath, held a moment, then let it out. "So you and Vince are tag-teamin' Chris, eh?"</p>
<p>I think my eyes widened for an instant because Sarah suddenly took on a satisfied smirk.</p>
<p>"I know you blow guys." She paused to see my reaction. "Do you take it up the ass?"</p>
<p>Another eye widening, this time with gritted teeth. "No..."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"...uh, it never occurred to me." I firmly shook my head.</p>
<p>She nodded to me and then leaned forward as if confiding in me. "Just so you know, Vince'll take it up the ass. You just gotta tell him you wanna to do it. He won't ask."</p>
<p>I sat there dumbfounded—no clue on how to respond. Is she setting me up or betraying Vince?</p>
<p>She pointed over my shoulder to the desk. "That thing you're working on. On the table. What is it? Looks like you're making your own telephone."</p>
<p>Just-like that first ride on the Sportster last week when I fumbled the clutch—I blinked a couple times and tried to catch up with Sarah.</p>
<p>I pivoted in my chair and looked at the project. "It's just an electronics project." I had left the soldering iron on.</p>
<p>"Why do you have it here?"</p>
<p>"I'm not on shift all the time. I gotta have things to do."</p>
<p>"So what is it?"</p>
<p>"It's a Blue Box. I made it in college from parts at Radio Shack. It lets you make long distance calls without having to pay.”</p>
<p>Sarah was really good at skeptical looks, as if she thought I made it up.</p>
<p>“It tricks the AT&T long distance lines into not logging the call in the billing system."</p>
<p>She drew her head back and settled on incredulous. "Show me."</p>
<p>"I can't right now. I'm fixing the wires on the battery case. Then I gotta buy some batteries. I can do that after I get cash for the poker shifts."</p>
<p>She smiled broadly at me, first time it seemed like she approved of me. "I think we can find you some batteries. Tell me how it works.”</p>
<p>“The exploit hinges on in-band control signals. When you’re on a call, you can make sounds that’ll cause the phone system do things. This device makes the phone system hang up the other end of the call, but not your end. You’re just sitting there connected to a long distance line that thinks it’s available to use. So dial a number, it’ll connect: no record, no billing, no trace.”</p>
<p>“Okay, what’s the catch?”</p>
<p>“The phone company is onto it. You can’t fool their newer equipment. It stopped working in Missoula a couple years ago. It still works where I live on the Rez. I wanna see if it works here.”</p>
<p>She nodded at me. “I do all the book keeping for the bar and the club. I got twenty-seven employees. I do the payroll, track inventory and do budgeting. What computer could—“</p>
<p>“IBM XT, Peachtree Accounting seems to be the popular choice. IBM’s gonna have a new machine out some time soon.”</p>
<p>She sat up straight and put her hands in her lap. "Think I get what Vince is doin’.” She leveled her eye at me. “Here's the deal. You ain't gonna pay for graduate school slingin' cards a few night a week. You keep dealin' for Chris, fine—but when you're not in the box, you work for me. You're gonna computerize our books." She paused and raised a wry smile. "Can think of other uses for you, too."</p>
<p>“I’d love to help you get you books onto the computer. Do you have one? What kind?”</p>
<p>“No, we gotta buy one. You can help us with that, too.”</p>
<p>My grin grew and my expectations flipped from resignation to excitement. Screw the card dealing, I wanted to talk about computers.</p>

<h2 id="IronHorse">Iron Horse</h2>
<p>I walked into the bar through the front door, still a couple hours from opening, eyes taking too long to adjust to the lower light level. Dolph stood behind the bar. One of the other bartenders, a guy in his late thirties, big mustache, no beard, bit of a paunch, wearing a black T-shirt tagged with “Whiskey” across the chest. Appropriately, he pulled bottles of Jack Daniels from under the bar while Dolph held a clipboard.</p>
<p>I didn’t see Chris, so I headed toward the dogleg corridor to the card room behind the bar.</p>
<p>Vince's angry voice from the open door of the office startled me.  He sounded furious. “What the fuck do you think I’m paying you for?” A moment silence then a crash—Vince's fist on the desk.  “Say it! Tell me right now. What I’m paying you to do?”</p>
<p>I darted by the open door, not looking in, grateful his focus was not on me. I rushed the five strides into the card room, nearly colliding with Chris coming the other way.</p>
<p>He grabbed my both my shoulders as we maneuvered to avoid the crash. "Ah, great, you're. Let's get some papers signed in the office. Then I'll walk you through the routines and the rules in the card room."</p>
<p>I winced as I heard more of Vince's shouting. "You’re takin’ this purchase order to the warehouse in Missoula. You’re bringin’ back the whole goddamn order of Jack. Go. Now!"</p>
<p>Just as we approached the office door, Grizz rushed out and headed toward the bar. I doubt he even saw us.</p>
<p>Chris whipped into the office. Apprehensive of Vince’s anger, lagging behind seemed the wise course, I stopped just inside the doorway.</p>
<p>The office had three desks and housed the backside of the cashier window for the card room. Vince stood at his desk, the one deepest into the room. He gave me a big smile when he saw me in the doorway.</p>
<p>I marveled how he could change his affect in just a few seconds. No sign of his anger from just seconds ago.</p>
<p>Chris’s strode straight to the desk on the left grabbing a clipboard and turned toward Vince gesturing with his right hand, fingers and thumb rubbing one another.</p>
<p>Vince looked down, flashed a quick grin and nodded. He grabbed a pen from his desk and tore a sheet off a notepad. He wrote for a moment, folded the paper in half and handed it to Chris. Vince grinned at me again and gave a nod.</p>
<p>I still waited by the doorway as Chris gestured me back into the hallway. I stepped backward. He whipped by me to the door across the hall, unlocking and opening it one smooth motion.</p>
<p>“We’ll talk in the apartment. Quieter there.”</p>
<p>He flipped on a light switch. The fluorescent tubes flickered then revealed a hallway, perpendicular to the first, having one door to the left, another the right and, at the end, a heavier door to the outside.  An exit behind a locked door with no illuminated exit sign—not fire code compliant.</p>
<p>He opened the door to the right and went in. Before I followed along, I looked at the door to the left. If my mental map of the building was correct, that would open into the fourth garage bay. Felt odd, like Chris led me the wrong way. I shook it off.</p>
<p>The room Chris actually led me to, surprised me—a fully furnished one room apartment. It had a kitchen, bathroom, washer and drier, a table large enough for six, couch, television and a bed.  I updated my mental map of the building. The kitchen and bathroom line up the back side of the bar's restrooms. Then imagining the rest of the building, I realized the bar's sinks rode that same line. Clever plumbing, just one wet wall in the design.</p>
<p>Chris sat down at the table with the clipboard, gestured me to join him.</p>
<p>Over the next twenty minutes he reviewed procedures for checking in at the beginning of the shift, the cash out procedures, and all the minutia of being an employee of the bar.</p>
<p>I signed the final document.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, you’re officially my employee and on the clock. This is for you.” He handed me a package containing two black tank top t-shirts.</p>
<p>I pulled one out and unfolded it. It said “Two Braids” and “Dealer” in white lettering.</p>
<p>“Two Braids? That’s what some of the students on the Rez called me.”</p>
<p>“Not surprising. Not many guys around with braids in his beard, let alone two of ‘em.  I told you you’d have nickname before end of the day.”</p>
<p>“I kinda hoped to make my own.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the way nicknames work around here. No body gets to choose their own.” He smiled at me. “Hey, did you bring that earring like I asked you to?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s in the motel room.”</p>
<p>“Make it part of your get up. If you're in the bar with the tank top on, you wear the earring, too. Your image is as important as your dealing skills. The tourists might not trust you, but they'll love to take the story home that they played poker at a biker bar. Like Vince said, it's a show.”</p>
<p>We sat in silence for a moment, when Chris suddenly said, “Oh, I nearly forgot. This is for you.”</p>
<p>He placed Vince’s folded paper on the table, put his finger on it, and slid over to me.</p>
<p>I picked it up, unfolded it, reading Vince’s words: “He’ll stop running his mouth if you fuck him. Make him shut up.” Followed by his unreadable signature.</p>
<p>I laughed.</p>
<p>Chris leered at me, his wicked grin blossoming. “You’re always supposed to do what the club president says." He looked to the clock on the wall. "We’ve got about forty minutes.” He gestured to the bed.</p>
<p>My body took over, my mind just hung on for the ride.</p>
<p>Lying on my back, he fucked himself with my dick. He took charge of every move our coupled bodies made. He controlled me with his ass. He could actually take me to the edge of coming, drag me back, and then build me up again—so grateful to him for giving me a full on experience of sexual ecstasy.</p>
<p>He was right, relaxed fucking is just as good as the frenetic stuff.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="IronHorse-CardRoom">Iron Horse - Card Room</h2>
<p>How could I not just power into the rest of the day feeling like a titan? Everything looked good to me.</p>
<p>We walked back to the card room about five minutes late for, what I learned, was the All Dealer's meeting. Apparently, a traditional meeting at the beginning of the Sturgis season.</p>
<p>Chris opened it up. "Hey everyone. Thank for coming in early today. It's gonna be a big weekend and we're all gonna make a lot of money."</p>
<p>"We got a new dealer today. This is Two Braids from over the mountains on the Blackfeet Rez."</p>
<p>I whipped my head around to look at Chris. That just didn't sound right—I wasn't a tribe member.</p>
<p>Chris moved on without noticing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0221" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"As you know, this is the mid-summer run weekend for the Bitterroot Bastards. They'll start arriving this afternoon round four. At six, all employees are invited to join the Bastards for barbecue salmon on the back patio.”</p>
<p>Murmurs of appreciation came from the assembled dealers.</p>
<p>Chris talked for twenty minutes. I realized this was more of a pep rally than a staff meeting. He did talk about special security measures for the weekend.</p>
<p>As everyone dispersed, he called out to one of them. “Lonna, I want you to be Two Braid’s guide. Show him all the table procedures. Walk him through checking out his tokes, signaling, everything."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0225" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The woman that separated from the rest of the dealers and came over had tits so large that I blinked—not sure they were real. As she approached, I had to drag my eyes up to her face, but they kept dropping back down—awkward as all hell. I was the last person they were aimed at, but even I couldn't easily look elsewhere.</p>
<p>Chris stayed long enough to introduce us and then retreated back to the office between the cardroom and the bar.</p>
<p>She stepped up to me and we shook hands. "Ah, you're the one that Sarah told me about. Never known a guy in our line of work."</p>
<p>No idea what she meant—most of the dealers were guys—I just nodded and smiled.</p>
<p>"We got our own meeting in about twenty minutes. We're gonna talk about what happened last weekend with Linda. Sarah tell you to come to?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0230" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I hesitated. "No, Sarah didn't mention anything to me."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0231" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As she turned and walked away, I got the feeling I missed something important here.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0233" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Sheila, the lady with the beehive hairdo from last weekend approached my table without even looking at me. She selected a seat, sat down and patiently waited for the current hand to finish with her purse sitting in her lap. She watched the game in progress.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0234" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When the buy started, she held a hundred dollar bill up to me and startled. Her brow furrowed as her eyes snagged on my dangling beaded earring.</p>
<p>“Welcome to my table, Sheila.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0236" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“You’re a dealer.” She paused, seemed confused for a second, then frowned at me. She shook her head, looked around at the other empty tables as if she wanted to switch. She had no other options, I dealt the only game in the room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0237" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I passed her chips to her. She methodically stacked them properly. Once done, she folded her hands on the edge of the table and waited for me to start.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0238" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As she was a new player at the table, I told her that this afternoon, that State betting limits were in force. I shuffled several times, cut the deck, and laid out the first hand.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0239" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Except for Sheila, all my player appeared to be tourists. Most of them were terrible players, obviously here just so they could say the played poker at a Montana biker bar.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0240" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Shiela steadily tapped into their holiday cash. I enjoyed watching her play, she played better, less emotionally, than she had last weekend.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0241" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The next couple hours went by really fast. Lonna checked up on me a couple times watching through a couple hands each time. Chris came in once to inspect me. He voiced no concerns.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0242" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My relief dealer showed up precisely at four. I had a twenty minute break. Lonna met me as I walk outside through the rear bay doors.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0243" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Staff had been busy out there while I dealt cards. A big area had been cordoned off with a low crowd fence between the railroad tracks and the two eastern most rolling bay doors. Picnic tables, folding trestle tables, even what looked like old doors up on crates. along the eastern perimeter fence, two large barbecues made from steel drums cut in half sat</p>
<p><b><span id="U0244" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>———> SYNC ERROR: a passage has gone missing here</p>
<p><b><span id="U0245" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Lonna caught up with me and we sat at a table and talked for a while.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0246" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Blackfoot Reservation?" She pierced me with her eyes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0247" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I retaliated. "Blackfeet Reservation. Feet, not foot. Blackfoot is a river. And, yes, I live just outside East Glacier on the Rez. I'm not a tribe member. I just ended up there."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0248" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My eyes still kept dropping to her tits—some sort of latent hetero instinct—couldn't shake it off.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0249" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Rough place?" She leaned in.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0250" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Haven't had trouble. Seen a lot of grizzlies. I taught computer programming at the tribal college."gggf</p>
<p><b><span id="U0251" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She drew back surprised. "Wow. Sarah's right about you."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0252" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I rolled my eyes, then deliberately, flattened my expression—not going to give her anything to read.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0253" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Lonna laughed at me. "We're not playing poker, Karl."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0254" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"From what I can tell, everyone is constantly playing poker around here." I leaned in toward her. "You're not a local are you?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0255" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She smiled. "I'm just here for the summer. I come up from Reno every year with Sarah."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0256" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You're a casino dealer." I thought for a moment and thought out loud, "That makes sense." Then directed at her, "You're really tight on the felt."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0257" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah, at Chris and Sarah's club card room." She maintained the smile.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0258" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Club? The Bastards in Reno?" The club is bigger than just here?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0259" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Club, casino, same thing. No association with the Bastards. Sarah and Chris run the casino and this bar way up here in Montana."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0260" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Computers in different cities—they could use modems to call each other—keep their data synchronized.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0261" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"That's the same look you have while you're dealing. I watched you dealing today...</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0263" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Our smalltalk continued until I my break ended and I returned to my table.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0265" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I sank into the old patterns of dealing—watching the cards go by—the patterns appearing then vanishing. Watched folks throwing their money at hands that could never pay out.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0266" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>By five o'clock, the place was crowded, six tables running. My players had turned over entirely several times. Shiela had cashed out long ago, more than doubling what she brought in. Nothing like the no limit games from last weekend.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0267" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Most of my new players wore Bitterroot Bastard colors. I got uncomfortable at times with they way they looked at me. Like drills—so many intense stares. Griz said that the club members had to get to know me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0268" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I kept the games moving, maybe a bit too fast. My table had a lot of turn over, guys almost seemed to cycle through on a schedule.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0269" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince even sat at my table for a while. He caught my eye between hands and gave me an upward nod.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0270" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>All these eyes on me bordered on unnerving me—felt self conscious and kept having to correct my posture. My back started to hurt, not used to dealing—never really thought about atrophied dealing muscles.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0271" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I could see more and more guys wearing colors out on the apron between the building and the tracks. The smell of cooking salmon drifted through the doorway. I realized I had never eaten lunch—fucked Chris instead.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0272" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dinner break did not come soon enough. Lonna stepped up to my table with my relief dealer, Nancy. I knew her from my trial dealing last weekend—she had witnessed my disastrous tarot card debacle.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0273" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Lonna and I walked out back toward the tracks where tables had been setup for staff to join the salmon feast.  There was a lot of it. We ate together, while she pushed me to tell her my story.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0274" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>In the midst of me telling her about my Bison Lakes base camp, I spotted Luke—the owner of the biker bar in Missoula. I stuttered and fell silent for a moment.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0275" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Lonna turned to see what I looked at. Looking back to me, her head tipped slightly to the side, her eyes urging me to explain.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0276" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>That long braid hung over his shoulder. I watched him talking animatedly with someone in the section for club members. I watched him laughing with his brothers. Goddamn but he was beautiful.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0277" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Sorry, distracted." I scrambled to remember what I had been telling her.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0278" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The corners of her mouth twitched into a sly smile. "Somebody you know?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0279" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I met her eyes, but didn't respond for a minute. "Not important."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0280" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She gave me a knowing smile. "Back in high school, I had a really good friend. Dennis. We always ran around together. He was really quiet, but when he smiled, it just lit up my day. He was gay. I really miss him."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0281" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You didn't stay in contact after graduation?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0282" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No, later that summer he got beat up pretty bad." Her face turned to pained. "About a week later, they found him in his car, running in the garage. I cried for a month."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0283" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My eyes slammed shut. After a deep breath, I opened them. Lonna looked stricken.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0284" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We both said, "I'm sorry" at the same time.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0285" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Lonna put her hand across the table onto mine. "When you said, 'Not important,' I saw him in you. I shouldn't have said that."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0286" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"That's the same reason I'm on the Rez." I spoke to our plates, looking down at the left over bones of salmon that swam blissfully in the lake only this morning. I pulled my eyes up to meet hers. "I never managed to pull the trigger."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0287" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We sat there in silence looking at each other with our hands touching. Lonna eventually broke the spell. "Time to get back to the tables."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0288" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As I stood up, I spotted Grizz staring at me with a "what the fuck?" look. Thinking about what he had just seen, I suspect he figured Lonna and I were hooking up. Fine, he can keep guessing.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0290" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He appeared at my table an hour later. It took all my control to not stare at that braid over his shoulder. The shifting patterns of the cards—distraction from watching Luke—would he remember me? I flipped him the Suicide King on fifth street. On the next hand, his Suicide King appeared on fourth street.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0291" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He stayed for only half dozen hands before cashing out with a lighter wallet than he started with.</p>
<hr>
<p>After my shift ended I turned in my toke box and cashed in my tips, I didn’t want to leave the party, so I wandered out to the bar. Grabbed an empty seat, the middle seat of three empties together.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0294" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Not stood there for more than a few seconds when the bartender, Drum, stepped up, pointedly reading my shirt.</p>
<p>“The dealer Mr. Two Braids. What can I get ya?”</p>
<p>“I’ll have one of those Apple Beer things.”</p>
<p>“Ah, still on shift are ya?” He leaned over to open a refrig door. Took him a while to find it. He set the bottle on the bar. “bottle or in a glass?”</p>
<p>“Bottle’s fine.”</p>
<p>I handed over a buck and added a quarter as tip as he set the bottle in front of me.</p>
<p>Drum had no time for small talk, he walked away to the till and then on to the next customer.</p>
<p>There were three bartenders working. By their tank tops, Drum, Whiskey, and Gauge. Two directly handling customers and one dedicated solely to the waitresses. I watched them work, dancing around each other, never colliding despite their tight floorspace. They all wore club cuts over their tank tops. I hadn't met any of them yet.</p>
<p>In the mirror behind the bar, I caught a movement approaching me from behind. I turned to see Chris with Luke in tow.</p>
<p>Chris turned to Luke as they stepped up. “This is the guy I told you about. Luke, meet Karl.”</p>
<p>I doubted Luke would remember me from two years ago—I was just kid he may have tried to pick up in his Missoula bar. Goddamn but he's beautiful.</p>
<p>We clasped forearms. My eyes pretty much sank into his and I had to work to pull them out.</p>
<p>“Luke was at my table this evening.” I fixed my eyes to that blonde rope of a braid hanging over his right shoulder. Gotta cover my fluster. “So in that second game, I thought you’d check raise on the turn. You didn’t have the queen?”</p>
<p>Luke turned laughing to Chris. “I see what you mean.”</p>
<p>He turned back to me. “Yeah, I fucked up, I did have the queen.”</p>
<p>“Ah, folded the winner, thought so. Tough call. I get the feeling that…was it T-bone? …he bluffs more than he should. Worked that time, though.”</p>
<p>He smiled at me, then looked back to Chris with his grin and they both nodded.</p>
<p>"Gotta get back to the card room." Chris gave me a single upward nod and slapped Luke's ass as he walked walked away.</p>
<p>Luke shook he head and pushed in beside me at the bar.</p>
<p>"Can I buy you another drink?" Luke leaned turned toward the bar to signal Drum.</p>
<p>"I just got this one, I'm gonna just nurse it." I returned his smile.</p>
<p>Looking back at me, he said, "Just do a shot with me?"</p>
<p>I crumbled inside. Gotta explain—again. "No thanks. I want to, but I can't."</p>
<p>He looked at me with one eyebrow down and then turned to the bar and yelled out, "Hey Drum! Shot of Jack."</p>
<p>The shot appeared in front of him in seconds. He snatched it, and downed it in one sweep of his arm.  He dropped the glass back on the table and put his hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>"C'mon out back to the keg. You need to start meetin' the Bastards."</p>
<p>He pressed on my shoulder to prompt me off my barstool.</p>
<p>I followed him back out through the card room to the party out on the patio between the building and the tracks.</p>
<p>They had fenced off a big square behind the building with metal barricades, fence segments that link together—club members and bar staff only.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0323" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Grizz stood by the opening with his arms crossed. He nodded at Luke as he passed, but scowled at me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0324" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>In rapid fire, I met a dozen of the Bastards. Trouble remembering names—but club names—like the names on Rez—so easy to remember—images of things to associate with a person rather than a name with no inherent meaning.</p>
<hr>
<p>“Bet ya’ didn’t think I’d recognize ya’.” He paused for my reply, but I didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>He continued, “You changed, the ink for sure, your beard’s longer.”</p>
<p>Again, I stayed silent.</p>
<p>“You got away." He chortled, shaking his head. “Ok, most of ‘em get away.”</p>
<p>I finally spoke up. “I didn’t understand. I’m sorry.” I let out a breath. “I wouldn’t have understood this evening if it hadn’t been Chris introducing us.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Luke and I exited the Club's party corral,walked along the back side of the building, past the open roll up doors. Just at the corner of the building, a shout came from the club section.</p>
<p>A voice called out over the din of the party. "Luke's gettin' laid!" A general drunken cheer from the Bastard's followed.</p>
<p>Luke shouted back over his shoulder, "Fuck you Carnie! You should be so lucky!" He slung his arm over me, moving to escort me away in full view of the Bastards.</p>
<p>I pulled back, my mouth agape—half expecting to get jumped. Too many eyes on us. Carnie stood laughing.  Grizz just glared at me.</p>
<p>"Whoa, whoa there, wild eyes." Luke reached out, caught my arm. "Nobody's after you." He gave a half laugh. "'Cept me, of course.  You're a twitchy fucker, aren't ya?"</p>
<p>"Relax. The Bastards don't give a shit who you fuck. They're not stupid, you know. Easier to get laid if the best lookin' guys are playin’ a different game. Less competition."  He put his hand on my back and lightly pushed me back into walking. "C'mon, lets go fuck around."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0338" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I walked on the balls of my feet—half ready to bolt. Pissed I just proved his point. I kept ahead—not gonna an arm over me again.</p>
<p>We walked in silence to my room across the lot. Building totally dark. The sportster gleamed with the reflected light of the neon on the bar across the lot.</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, Snake said you were on Ed’s Ironhead. It's been years since I've seen it. How's the ride?"</p>
<p>"I really like it." I explained my Honda as I unlocked the door, pushed it open and flipped the light switch.</p>
<p>Nothing lit up. I felt my way in the desk and tried the desk lamp. It wouldn’t turn on either. I moved on to groping for the bed. I got some light of the bedside table lamp.</p>
<p>My riding leathers lay on the floor at the foot of the bed. My pack spilled over a chair. My electronic project crowded the desk.</p>
<p>Luke looked around the room, his gaze lingering on the bare studwall  bathroom. “Love what you’ve done with the place.”</p>
<p>I snorted.</p>
<p>Luke put his hand on my shoulder and leaned in toward me. With his other hand, he reached out and stroked the side of my face gently down to my chin and pulled very lightly on my beard braids.</p>
<p>He leaned his face close to mine and followed the path that his hand had taken with his hairy cheek and chin. "These braids are really hot, man. You are really hot." His lips met mine as he gently push me onto the bed.</p>
<p>For the first time in my life, I experienced love making instead of disconnected acts of sex, fucking, sucking. Seamless swings between gentle and rough—muscle, hair, scent—full body contact—not centered on just dicks, mouth, and ass. Whole body sex.</p>
<p>I how did I not know this?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0350" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>His cum shots pushed me over the edge, not even handling our dicks, just pressed between us. We ended side by side, face to face, sticky and panting.</p>
<p>Luke began to laugh. "Snake and Carnie said you were a trip." His smile beamed. "We don't fuck around as much as we used to. Bet we could get a hell of a foursome goin'. You'd like that?"</p>
<p>I nodded, returning his smile.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0353" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He sat up and looked around for the clock. "Just after midnight. I'm gonna head back to the party. You comin'?" He started to sort through our randomly discarded clothes.</p>
<p>"I'll come back out in a bit. I need some time in the quiet for a few minutes." I watched him pull on his jeans followed by his sleeveless button shirt.  Finally pulled the Bastard cut over the shirt.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0355" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I started gathering my own clothes. I looked down only for a few moments and heard the door close.</p>
<p>Luke was gone.</p>
<p>I dressed and straighten up the bed a bit. I froze when I spotted the stack of bills on the side table by the lamp.</p>
<p>I counted them out—seventy-five dollars. I checked my pants pocket for my wallet and found the cash I expected. My tips—pawed through pants pocket and found the wad of cash that the cashier had given me for the tokes I turned in.</p>
<p>Luke left this.</p>
<p>I stood there thinking about the money and sex—was this normal?</p>
<p>Folded the cash up and packed it and my tip money into an inner pocket of my backpack.</p>
<p>The clock read twenty minutes after midnight. I stepped outside and watched the bar across the lot—music, engine revs, voices rising from the back by the tracks. I felt the pull of noise, the need to crowd out the tangled thoughts in my head.</p>
<p>I crossed the lot and made my way around the building to the fenced club party.</p>
<p>Grizz stepped into my path, shook his head. "Club only."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0365" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stopped. Of course. Luke had taken me in before. I scanned the crowd, didn’t see Luke.</p>
<p>I shrugged and turned toward the open bay of the cardroom.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0367" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Only a few steps away, I heard low and angry from behind, "faggot." I looked over my shoulder, felt pierced by Grizz's glare.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0368" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I kept walking.</p>
<p>Quiet in the cardroom, not much action at the tables. Considered sitting in to play, but recalled Vince's warning last weekend not to hustle his players. I veered away.</p>
<p>I passed the corridor to the clubroom. The guards didn’t look at me.  I stepped into the sparsely populated bar. Lonna sat at on barstool, laughing with some guy. Not club. I drifted closer, hoping for a word. She never turned or even glanced at me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0371" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I detoured around the pool tables, considered the pinball machine that I played last weekend, skipped it. I strode out the front door. The bouncer, didn't know his name, never even acknowledged me.</p>
<p>Walked back to my room feeling overwhelmed, just like last week.  Too much happening too quickly.</p>
<p>That asshole in the Chevy this morning—seemed like days ago.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0374" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Oughta sleep. I trudged over to my room, fumbled the key, then fell onto the bed in my jeans and boots.</p>
<p>The bed sheets smelled like Luke.</p>
<p>I woke to noises from the next room. A man and woman—fucking. Didn't know I had neighbors. After a couple minutes, I recognized the woman's voice—Lonna.</p>
<p>I rolled over—Luke's scent again.</p>
<p>I thought we had really connected. The stack of bills sent a different message. Just like David the Sovereign Citizen, it's just a transaction between free men—didn't mean shit.</p>
<p>The connection dawned on me, I'm the first guy Lonna knew in this business.</p>
<p>Seventy-five bucks—I could eat for a month on that.</p>
<p>I didn't fall asleep again for a very long time.</p>
