            <h2 id="GoatLick,Montana">Goat Lick, Montana</h2>
<p>US2 westbound—I stood on the edge of the highway overlooking Goat Lick—a gorge made by the Middle Fork of the Flathead. No riverbanks—just steep talus slopes of oddly white crumbling rock stained with rust red streaks pointing down into the whitewater river.</p>
<p>Across the the top of the largest mountainside scar, an improbable BN freight train crawled on level tracks. The juxtaposition of engineering and the raw unstable geology defied sense—didn't look real.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I had seen this flash by countless times—today I stopped to marvel at it. Without any sort of proper pullout for gawking, it felt dicey to stand sandwiched between full speed highway traffic and the ribbon of guard rail on a shoulder barely wide enough for the bike.</p>
<p>Didn't matter—I watched the train until the end. Another train without caboose. Has a railroad era really ended?</p>
<p>I remounted the bike—facing west on the eastbound shoulder—and took off, chasing and then pacing the train on the mountainside across the valley. Eventually, the valley widened and the railroad and highway chose diverging routes for a dozen miles. I pulled way in front and lost sight of the locomotives.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="HungryHorse,Montana">Hungry Horse, Montana</h2>
<p>I passed through West Glacier, and prepared for the speed-up slow-down routine of the next twelve miles—four small towns in rapid succession, each with town speed limits and very short full speed highway sections between them. I needed to pass several cars to get myself in the best position for the curves in Badrock Canyon. I didn't want anyone in front of me so I could take the curves at my own speed.</p>
<p>I passed an eighteen wheeler between Belton and Corum. Got around another couple cars between Corum and Martin City. Hungry Horse—speed down to thirty-five, the biggest of the towns, I prayed nobody would pull into that clear highway ahead.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>No such luck. A local's pickup pulled in just before the bridge over the Flathead river. The other side, the speed limit went back to fifty-five and the curves began. Half way across the bridge, the truck's left turn signal came on. My heart leapt—they headed to the fishing access road.</p>
<p>Moments later I had my clear lane ahead of me. Satisfied grin—I accelerated, kicking it into fourth.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>One car on the shoulder ahead—flashing hazards. I moved to the left toward the double yellow—set fly by them and into the lean for the first curve.</p>
<p>Suddenly—the car moved—turned broadside across my lane—a fucking U-turn.</p>
<p>Hard on the rear brake—just a split second—off the throttle. Dump speed fast—off the brake—like my heart collided with my ribs. Counter steer left—lean hard right, take the bike with me. Riding the sidewalls, the right foot peg scraped the fog line. Yank the bike back upright. Counter steer right—lean hard left—front tire chirped, but held.</p>
<p>Holy shit, holy shit.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Now flying upright along the shoulder—slicing the car's late morning shadow—eyes on the car’s rear bumper—left foot peg, inches of clearance—orange license plate—Reagan/Bush bumper sticker.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Kicking up gravel behind. Wood debris ahead. Quick reverse it—lean hard left and snap right—back in the travel lane, upright—guard rail banking left dead ahead—leaned left into the first curve of Badrock Canyon. Roll the throttle out of the curve. Goddamn—the torque of this machine—no need to downshift.</p>
<p>Too late to look in the mirror—nothing to see but the river beyond the curved asphalt. Breathe dammit, breathe.</p>
<p>I swallowed hard. Focus on staying alive—taking each curve as it presented itself. Took only a moment to glance up at that one cliff outcrop that juts out over the highway—gonna fall someday.</p>
<p>A dozen tight curves behind me, I streaked out of Badrock Canyon, a mile before the turn into Columbia Falls.</p>

<h2 id="TheIronHorse">The Iron Horse</h2>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Ten minutes later, I coasted into the Horse's empty parking lot with my heart still pounding. I swung the bike into the spot near the front door. Place looked closed—nobody around. I just sat there with my boots firmly planted on the ground, reliving that swerve around the idiot in the Chevy. I could still see him, head turned the wrong way—never even knew I was there.</p>
<p>"You Karl?"</p>
<p>I jerked in surprise having neither seen nor heard the guy step up. My ears still rang from the wind noise. "Yeah."</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Snake said you might roll in early. C’mon ‘round back—no sense bakin’ out here in the sun. Name’s Grizz."</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Still on the bike, I turned to look. The name fit—big burly guy with a fierce wide reddish beard, probably about 30. Sounded like he said, "Snake"—didn't make sense.</p>
<p>He stopped, taking a closer look at me. "Something happen?" He said to me with his head slightly cocked to the side.</p>
<p>My head turned back forward on the bike and saw both my hands, white knuckles still on the bars. I let out a long breath and let go. "Some ass in a Chevy pulled a fucking U-turn from the shoulder right in front of me. Missed by inches. I was doin’ sixty just this side of Hungry Horse before Bad Rock.”</p>
<p>"What was it—clueless Iowa flatlander or a rez buck with a baling wire  bumper?"</p>
<p>I hesitated, thinking of the driver’s turned head. "Never saw his face.  Orange plate, though. Don't know what state's orange..."</p>
<p>I shoved the side stand down, leaned the bike onto it, and dismounted.</p>
<p>Grizz towered over me.  He offered his hand—we clasped wrists.  He turned to walk away. "C'mon around to the shade, we've got the patio open."</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I followed him along the west side of the building and then around to the back. The mainline of the BN paralleled the building with a gap about the width of US2. I got the impression that Horse's brick building formerly served as a truck engine shop for the old Great Northern Railroad.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The rear wall consisted of four garage doors tall enough for big rigs.  The second from the right stood open revealing the card room. I had to stand and look at for a minute. I'd swear that there were only three bay doors in the card room. A couple tables sat on the apron in front of the gaping door. What was behind door number four?</p>
<p>I smiled as I saw Dolph sitting at a table facing me.</p>
<p>"Howdy, Dolph. Nice to see you again." He looked from a notepad and nodded his silent greeting with a hint of a smile.</p>
<p>Griz and I sat down at the table. Dolph went right back to writing on his notepad.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Grizz peered at me as if trying to figure out what I was. "So uh… what makes you so special? Snake says the whole club supposed to get to know you or somethin’."</p>
<p>"Whaddaya mean?" I didn't know anything about this.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I spotted Dolf closing his notepad and frowned at Grizz just as a low slowly pulsing rumble started to vibrate the air. A gang of Burlington Northern SD40s pulling a mile long string of grainers.</p>
<p>Grizz noticed Dolf's frown and backed down. "Not sayin’ nothin’ bad, I’m just askin’. That’s all." He pasted an obviously fake smile on his face and looked back to me.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I don't know anything about what Snake said, let alone why he said it, or even who the hell he is. It's news to me. I'm just a card dealer. Gimme a minute, I'm gonna checkout this train."</p>
<p>The train’s turbo whine spooled up as it accelerated on the stretch of track out of Bad Rock Canyon straight to Whitefish. I got up and walked toward the tracks, forgetting all about Grizz and Dolph in my eagerness to stand near the tracks. No fence divided the right of way from the concrete. I loved the way the rumble vibrated my chest. Kinda like the bike, but deeper.</p>
<p>I stood there for the whole train length to pass feeling the vibration and reveling in its accompanying wind. This was the same unit train that I saw crossing the cliff at Goat Lick. I wandered back to the table without explaining myself.</p>
<p>Grizz looked at me funny, like I had acted weird.</p>
<p>I looked at him straight in the eye. "It's a great rush. You oughta try it." I took in his skeptical look and raised the stakes as I sat back down across from him. "The real rush is climbing up under the tracks an end of the bridge. You can lie down just under the ties. When the locomotives roll over, it's a rush like ya can't believe."</p>
<p>Griz shook his head. "Where'd did you come from?"</p>
<p>"I live on the Blackfeet Rez near East Glacier."</p>
<p>His nodded his as if I had just explained everything odd about me. "Dealing on the rez? Huh. That new, or just under the table like everything else over there?"</p>
<p>"No, of course not, there's no card rooms on the Rez. I was teaching at the tribal college."</p>
<p>He shot me another what-the-hell stare. "Teachin'? Why do the injuns need to learn to deal cards? That's all we need a bunch of bucks at the card tables."</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>What the fuck? This guy gets the wrong idea and then just runs with it.   "Jesus Christ, no." I shook my head at "bucks"—as if the men of the tribes didn't even qualify as people. "I taught computer programming."</p>
<p>He stared at me for an awkward moment. "Computers? Figures." He turned to Dolph. "We lettin’ the scrawny nerds run the poker tables now?"</p>
<p>This was a goddamn test—he's baiting me. I glanced over at Dolph. He just looked at me as if waiting to see my reaction. Has everyone gotta test me today?</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Can't start off my first day making enemies. I gotta turn this guy around and make him like me.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Smiles, nods—just agree with him. "Yup, I'm a bona fide nerd, but here today I'm a card dealer. They hired me to run tables, I'm here to do my job."</p>
<p>I looked over at Dolph and then back to Grizz. "Since you’re hanging here with Dolph, I'm guessing you're one of the bouncers—I'm gonna rely on you to protect my nimble fingers, the cards, and my toke box. I look forward to seeing you in action. What's the worst you've seen? Does it get bad here?"</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Grizz flashed genuine grin. "Coupla weeks ago, these college kids stumble outta the bar. I'm watchin' from the lot, just lettin' 'em clear out. One of 'em—tall shit in a MSU Bobcat t-shirt—gets this genius idea to jump onto Carnie's chopper, playin' like he's ridin'.” He leaned toward me, like he decided to speak in confidence. “That’s the club president’s bike. You’ll probably meet him today."</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Carnie?</p>
<p>His voice got excited, enjoying the climax of his story. "Didn't shout. Didn't warn. I walk over, grab him by the collar, and bounce his head off the asphalt—twice, just to be sure he remembers. His buddies step up and I decked 'em before they even knew what happened. They limped outta lot all quiet with piss in their pants."</p>
<p>I nodded and smiled, doing my best to look impressed.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Nobody touches Carnie’s scoot. Not on my watch.” Grizz returned the smile. “Carnie is a great guy. You always show him respect. He’s the boss. Do what he says.”</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I dawned on me. Carnie is Vince. Could Snake be Chris?</p>
<p>I thought about Vince and me swapping blowjobs last weekend. Grizz had no clue how well I already knew the president—I nodded to him, accepting his advice.</p>
<p>A new rumble rolled in—deep and familiar, not a train this time. Harleys. Choppers.</p>
<p>I grinned. "That’s Vince and Chris now. Doesn’t sound like he’s fixed that pushrod issue yet." I looked directly at Grizz.</p>
<p>Dolph closed his notepad. "Yup. Doin' that since last Summer. Lifters been trouble since he built it."</p>
<p>Grizz gave me a puzzled look. I could see the question cross his mind—how's this nerdy little fucker know anything about the President's chopper?</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked to Dolph. "So Carnie is Vince? Is Snake Chris?"</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph nodded to me silently.</p>
<p>About two minutes later, Vince strode into the cardroom through the door to the bar, heading straight for our table just outside in the shade. He didn’t even glance at the others. Just came straight to me.</p>
<p>"Karl! Buddy—glad you’re joinin’ the crew today. Gonna be a hell of a good weekend."</p>
<p>I stood up, stepped toward Vince with my hand out. Instead reaching for my handshake, he pulled me into a fraternal bear hug, slapping me on the back a couple times. He released the hug, and turned to face the table, with his arm still on my shoulder.</p>
<p>"You already know Dolph, and you've met Grizz. You’ll be meetin’ a lotta solid guys over the next three days. The boys'll start rollin' in by four or so. This place'll be hoppin' t'night through the weekend. We're feedin' the whole club here tonight. Yogi, Wrench and Slim are out on the lake right now trollin' for Kokanee. Gonna have a hell of salmon feed."</p>
<p>Grizz’s grin had frozen. For a second, he just blinked at us, then his eyes harded to a glare. I suspect I just crossed a line that Grizz didn't like. He looked away and leaned back in his chair to respond to Vince.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Yeah, we been gettin’ acquainted.” He shifted, sat up straighter, eyes flicking between me and Vince. “Looks like Karl already knows his way around better'n I figured.”</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I caught a flicker of a grin from Dolph—just a glance aimed squarely at Grizz and then to me. He went back to his notepad.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Grizz didn’t notice. Just scratched the back of his neck and turned to stare off into the cardroom as if watching out for intruders. I figured I just got branded as the intruder.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I startled when another arm dropped across my shoulders from the other side—Chris. A breath later—fear—can’t have them so close to me in front of strangers. What if it made me...too late. My dick pushed against my left leg, and I stood facing Grizz.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Needed to hide that—I pulled away, turning to face them—shielding my bulging pants from Grizz and Dolph.</p>
<p>Just like last weekend, challenges came fast and furious on the west side of the mountains.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Hey, Chris." He seemed surprised I bolted, but I watched his eyes drag down my body to my uncomfortably constrained hardon. He smirked.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince stepped over to the table to speak with Dolph.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris smiled wickedly at me. "Good ride from the eastside this morning?"</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I explained the incident with the car broadside on the highway.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Sounds like you've got that bike properly under you.” He laughed. “Bet you rode every day since we left."</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I smiled. "Yeah, I did. There's this road on the Rez called Mollies Nipple—gravel—follows Birch Creek in this twisty little canyon. It's a blast."</p>
<p>Chris nodded and smiled, but then switched to business mode. "We got paperwork to do and get you settled into a room next door. Let's do that first." He turned and walked to the same side door where we stashed my Honda last weekend.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Motel1">Motel 1</h2>
<p>The side exit from the card room faced a rundown strip of a motel. The rooms, about ten of them in a line, looked increasingly derelict from the left at the road to the right by the railroad tracks. The last three rooms had plywood nailed over the windows. The wood shingle siding, a filthy pastel coral, pegged the last paint job to the 1960s.</p>
<p>Looking at the building's position near the old Great Northern Truck shop and the railroad tracks I could guess the history. It had likely been overnight quarters for railroad workers, probably as far back as the steam era. No space for a front office affirmed the idea in my mind.</p>
<p>Chris turned and spoke over his right shoulder to me. "You're gonna be in the leftmost room, it's the most done. Bring your bike over and get unloaded. Leave the Sportster over here, the lot's gonna be full before this evening."</p>
<p>I walked around to the Horse's front door. Chris and Vince had parked their choppers on either side of the Ironhead—just like they flanked me in the cardroom a few minutes ago—some sort of statement? I pulled the bike out from between the choppers and rolled over to my weekend digs. Chris stood by the open door.</p>
<p>I didn't have much to unload, just backpack of clothes in the right bag. I had included a couple books and my current electronics project. There will be down time and I'm not gonna want a crowd.</p>
<p>The room was unfinished. Only the walls adjacent to the neighboring unit had drywall. The bathroom walls were just studs displaying the sink, a toilet and a shower stall to the rest of the room. I surmised by the random scattering of the rugs, they covered flaws in the obviously new concrete floor—a bed, an red lit digital alarm clock, couple lamps, a table, a chair and a desk.</p>
<p>I set my pack and bags on the floor near the desk. Chris had his hand on my crotch before he even had the door shut. My dick reacted as Chris obviously expected.</p>
<p>"You wanna fuck your boss?"</p>
<p>I just looked at him. I didn't know what to say, while every nerve in my body shouted, "yeah, let's fuck now."</p>
<p>Chris started to tug on my belt.</p>
<p>"Wait. Umm." Was it okay to have sex with Chris when Vince wasn't there? Do I ask him that question or is it supposed to be obvious? "Vince isn't here." I stammered it out.</p>
<p>Chris looked at me puzzled. "...So?"</p>
<p>"uhh, I mean, is it ok with him? I don't know how this works."</p>
<p>"You're fine—don't need a permission slip."</p>
<p>"Umm, yeah, I'd love to, but I need a break. Too much already today. I don’t wanna burn out like last weekend."</p>
<p>He didn't respond for a moment. "Bet you've never had slow relaxing sex, have ya? That's ok, there'll be plenty of time."</p>
<p>He stepped to the door, pulled it open before turning back to me. "Come over to the office behind the bar in about a half hour. We got paperwork to do. You unwind." Then his expression changed to wolfish grin. "We'll fuck later when I've got you on the clock." He shut the door behind him.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="Motel2">Motel 2</h2>
<p>I sat at the deck in my motel room trying to compose myself. All of these new people—this whole scene—</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I had my electronics project spread out as I started soldering... A knock on my door broke my concentration. I scowled and opened the door.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Sarah stood there on a mission.</p>
<p>“Karl. We need to talk.” She looked around, then pushed past me with a flat, “May I come in,” but not as a question.</p>
<p>"Sure." I felt my brow furrow as she pushed by me.</p>
<p>She surveyed the room. "Goddamn, they haven't even finished the drywall in here." She looked around. "They only gave you one chair?”</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She sat on the edge of the bed and gestured to my chair at the desk. She looked at me for a moment as if trying to read me. "I'll be blunt. What's your angle?"</p>
<p>I just looked at her in confusion.</p>
<p>Her expression turned into a glare. "I don’t buy that wide-eyed act from last weekend. If you can bluff a card table half as good as Chris says, I don’t see why you wouldn’t try bluffin’ me now. You're after something here. What is it?"</p>
<p>"I'm, uh, sorry. I need the job."</p>
<p>"No, it's more than that. Vince and Chris turn tricks all the time. They never bring their boys into our house and they never see ‘em more than once."</p>
<p>“Turn tricks? Whaddya mean?”</p>
<p>"Oh, come off it. Vince’s talkin’ about bendin’ club rules just to keep you close, and he’s already stuck you on a club bike like you earned it. And Chris? He’s struttin’ around grinnin’ like a kid with a double dip ice cream cone. This ain't normal. So what’s the play here, sweetheart?"</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I sat there, gaping like a fool. “I don’t have a play. I don’t even know what this is.”</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She narrowed her eyes. “All right then—what’d they tell you?” She eye’d me hard enough to push me back against my seat.</p>
<p>“Said they need new blood in the club. They think I got skills nobody else’s got around here.”</p>
<p>Her eyes didn’t falter. “Poker we got. What I don’t get is why Vince thinks you’re some sort of missing piece.”</p>
<p>“I’m a computer programmer. Says he wants younger guys with new ideas.”</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Computer programmer?" Her skepticism felt like a slap. "You don't look the part. What makes you one?"</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I got a degree in it. Bachelor degree in Computer Science."</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She nodded, still steeped in distrust. “Go on…”</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“I programmed for that school records company in East Glacier until this spring. Didn't get along with Bill, the owner. I really wanna go on to grad school, masters. Don’t have the money… and what’s the point? I know what I am.  I’m illegal in this state. I’ll probably be dealing cards for the rest of my life, I might as well get started.”</p>
<p>I think I saw her eyes soften and then switch to calculating. She didn’t say anything, just looked at me.</p>
<p>I had to fill the silence. “Chris's job offer is the only thing I got. Now I’m… here.” I dropped my eyes to the floor.</p>
<p>She pursed her lips, stayed silent for a moment. “They should’ve told me more. But they didn’t. And that ain’t your fault.” She finally looked away from me. “Goddamn him, always playin’ savior." She looked back. "Does this with cats, too, y'know."</p>
<p>She looked hard at me for a full half minute, and then took a deep breath, held a moment, then let it out. "So you and Vince are tag-teamin' Chris, eh?"</p>
<p>I think my eyes widened for an instant because Sarah suddenly took on a satisfied smirk.</p>
<p>"I know you blow guys." She paused to see my reaction. "Do you take it up the ass?"</p>
<p>Another eye widening, this time with gritted teeth. "No..."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"...uh, it never occurred to me." I firmly shook my head.</p>
<p>She nodded to me and then leaned forward as if confiding in me. "Just so you know, Vince'll take it up the ass. You just gotta tell him you wanna to do it. He won't ask."</p>
<p>I sat there dumbfounded—no clue on how to respond. Is she setting me up or betraying Vince?</p>
<p>She pointed over my shoulder to the desk. "That thing you're working on. On the table. What is it? Looks like you're making your own telephone."</p>
<p>Just-like that first ride on the Sportster last week when I fumbled the clutch—I blinked a couple times and tried to catch up with Sarah.</p>
<p>I pivoted in y chair and looked at the project. "It's just an electronics project." I had left the soldering iron on.</p>
<p>"Why do you have it here?"</p>
<p>"I'm not on shift all the time. I gotta have things to do."</p>
<p>"So what is it?"</p>
<p>"It's a Blue Box. I made it in college from parts at Radio Shack. It lets you make long distance calls without having to pay.”</p>
<p>Sarah was really good at skeptical looks, as if she thought I made it up.</p>
<p>“It tricks the AT&T long distance lines into not logging the call in the billing system."</p>
<p>She drew her head back and settled on incredulous. "Show me."</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I can't right now. I'm fixing the wires on the battery case. Then I gotta buy some batteries. I can do that after I get cash for the poker shifts."</p>
<p>She smiled broadly at me, first time it seemed like she approved of me. "I think we can find you some batteries. Tell me how it works.”</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“The exploit hinges on in-band control signals. When you’re on a call, you can make sounds that’ll cause the phone system do things. This device makes the phone system hang up the other end of the call, but not your end. You’re just sitting there connected to a long distance line that thinks it’s available to use. So dial a number, it’ll connect: no record, no billing, no trace.”</p>
<p>“Okay, what’s the catch?”</p>
<p>“The phone company is onto it. You can’t fool their newer equipment. It stopped working in Missoula a couple years ago. It still works where I live on the Rez. I wanna see if it works here.”</p>
<p>She nodded at me. “I do all the book keeping for the bar and the club. I got twenty-seven employees. I do the payroll, track inventory and do budgeting. What computer could—“</p>
<p>“IBM XT, Peachtree Accounting seems to be the popular choice. IBM’s gonna have a new machine out some time soon.”</p>
<p>She sat up straight and put her hands in her lap. "Think I get what Vince is doin’.” She leveled her eye at me. “Here's the deal. You ain't gonna pay for graduate school slingin' cards a few night a week. You keep dealin' for Chris, fine—but when you're not in the box, you work for me. You're gonna computerize our books." She paused and raised a wry smile. "Can think of other uses for you, too."</p>
<p>“I’d love to help you get you books onto the computer. Do you have one? What kind?”</p>
<p>“No, we gotta buy one. You can help us with that, too.”</p>
<p>My grin grew and my expectations flipped from resignation to excitement. Screw the card dealing, I wanted to talk about computers.</p>
<hr>
<p>I walked into the bar through the front door, eyes taking too long to adjust to the lower light level. Dolph stood behind the bar. One of the other bartenders, a guy in his late thirties, big mustache, no beard, bit of a paunch, wearing a black T-shirt tagged with “Whiskey” across the chest. Appropriately, he pulled bottles of Jack Daniels from under the bar while Dolph held a clipboard.</p>
<p>Since the place wasn’t open yet, few other in the bar. I didn’t see Chris, so I headed toward the dogleg corridor to the card room behind the bar.</p>
<p>Vince's angry voice from the open door of the office startled me.  He sounded so furious. “What the fuck do you think I’m paying you for?” A moment silence then a crash—Vince's fist on the desk.  “Say it! Tell me right now. What I’m paying you to do?”</p>
<p>I darted by the open door, not looking in, grateful his focus was not on me. I rushed the five strides into the card room, nearly colliding  with Chris coming the other way.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He grabbed my both my shoulders as we maneuvered to avoid the crash. "Ah, great, you're. Let's get some papers signed in the office. Then I'll walk you through the routines and the rules in the card room."</p>
<p>I winced as I heard more of Vince's shouting. "You’re takin’ this purchase order to the warehouse in Missoula. You’re bringin’ back the whole goddamn order of Jack. And you better be back before Slim and Yogi are done grillin’ that salmon."</p>
<p>Just as we approached the office door, Grizz rushed out and headed toward the bar. I doubt he even saw us.</p>
