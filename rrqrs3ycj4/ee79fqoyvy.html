            <h2 id="BisonLakesCampsite">Bison Lakes Campsite</h2>
<p>I felt it, but I didn't understand it. Not steady enough to be a locomotive laboring up the pass a few miles north. Too close—slightly the wrong direction. The vibration—felt it more than heard it.  Spun up and down as if laboring—heavy equipment.</p>
<p>Scanned around my campsite assessing my readiness to head out south to Two Medicine Ridge. My cache, two days of food, hung from a tree about forty yards from my tent site. I staged it here on the weekend the Horse Burned.</p>
<p>I laid out watching the stars on this very spot when Vince died.</p>
<p>“Enough!”</p>
<p>At my emotional shout, a startled magpie burst from the tree above screaming a retort.</p>
<p>Christ, got to stop falling into that same goddamn hole.</p>
<p>I had another cache a day east up the ridge to North Half-Dome Craigs.</p>
<p>My adventure laid out before, ready to go—before everything changed—again.</p>
<p>I hefted my pack on my back, wiggled it into position, then drew the straps tighter. The load shifted from my shoulders to resting by friction on my hips.</p>
<p>Once I scrambled from the glacial bowl holding my beloved Bison Lakes, the vibration became clear. Yellow bulldozers—tiny from this distance—chewing a scar across the face of the hillside flesh above the South Fork of the Two-Medicine. A corporate middle finger to the Blackfeet and the National Park System.</p>
<p>They cheated. They didn't have to push through the river canyon, they cut from US2 on Marias Pass, gentler terrain to intercept the river a couple miles west from my ridgeline perch.</p>
<p>This was wilderness—not with a capital W kind—virgin land, protected by no law, just convention. Gotta stop this shit—just pulling stakes didn't make it too expensive explore here.</p>
<p>Later—got business to do first.</p>
<p>My trail, descending into the river valley, started as a deer trail. Turned into just hoofing it across open hillsides.  Not heading toward the bulldozers. Just shortest path down to the river.</p>
<p>Dry alpine country. The summer wildflowers in monochrome drifts before me. Yellow, the main color of July, Arrow Leaf Balsom Root. Looked like good terrain for Bitterroot—I didn't see any—probably too late for this elevation.</p>
<p>As the pitch of my descent increased, my walking cadence shifted to my heels—firm heel strike, traction, stability. Not a rocky canyon, this river cut through old glacial till, sand, gravel, boulders, random mix, moraine.</p>
<p>I grinned hard as I got to the river—not big, but big enough to earn the status of river. The coolest thing, only riverbanks parallel it. No roads. No pipelines. No power-lines.</p>
<p>I stood there listening. Couldn't hear the bulldozers.</p>
<p>The water had calmed a lot since last time I hiked this way. I worked my way upstream until I spotted my crossing point at Mettler Coulee. The boulders, relatively flat topped and roughly evenly spaced, gave me  eleven steps to cross. A month ago, raging whitewater tumbled over them like they weren't there.</p>
<p>Who the fuck was Mettler?</p>
<p>Once across, though, the job became much more difficult. The coulee heading south boxed-up, forcing a zigzag up through the denser trees and undergrowth up onto the shoulder. Took me about forty minutes to get back up into the more open ridge terrain.</p>
<p>Now had to follow along the bare west side of the parallel ridges, cross one perpendicular drainage then hit the ridge on the divide with Hyde Creek. From there it was a straight hike up to Mt Baldy—how many Mt Baldys in the world?</p>
<p>The south side of the bare Mt Baldy blushed with pink flowers. I knew them well, bitterroots. The namesake flower of the Bitterroot Bastards. It didn't appear on the patch, a mass of cock-sucker pink petals emerging directly from the ground. No leaves until later in the summer, but by fall, even they've withered leaving no trace that the underground plant exists.</p>
<p>My camp site sat nestled between boulders below the peak in a draw with a great view east to the morning sun. From the tops of the protective boulders, my final destination beckoned only a few rugged miles on the ridgeline south.</p>
<p>The flat sandy level spot gave me just enough room for my tent. Didn't take long to set it up. My cache of firewood waited patiently under the overhang just above the tent site. Beneath it, I dug up the food cache I'd buried weeks ago.</p>
<p>As night fell, I sat on the highest boulder smoking a joint. The shadow on the front range mountains stretched out, longer and longer, into the land of the Blackfeet, until lost in the haze of the horizon.</p>
<p>I sat near my tiny campfire while I ate the rations that I carried from Bison Lakes in the morning. As darkness fell a few clouds drifted into my sky, I slept inside the tent to get out of the wind.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A small handful, mostly ash gray, but hints of yellow and greenish blue. The smell, sour, like mildew. I tossed the mushroom into my mouth and began to chew. Struggled with it, the urge to spit out grew hard to resist—distraction, just keep hiking.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>With North Half-Dome Craigs firmly in my view I took off up the ridge. No trail here. The trees grew low and gnarled with a pronounced tendency to crowd all their branches to the east—brutal winds tear down the shoulders of the peak to the west.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When I stopped for a break about forty minutes later, I relaxed into the mushroom buzz.  My body amazed me. My legs, levers linked end to end, with my own living meat coordinating the joints to propel this awkward vertical form up the mountain.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I didn’t rest long, I felt compelled to keep the body moving. Living in my body—aware of tiny muscle groups, throughout my body, cooperating to hold my balance while I climbed ever higher up the ridge.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I was tripping hard.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I began choosing my path based on which muscles I wanted to feel working. The ridge line did not always ascend. The switch to downhill sections sent shivers through me as different muscle groups automatically took over—didn’t even have to think about it—it just happened.</p>
