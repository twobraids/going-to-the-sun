            <h2 id="BisonLakesCampsite">Bison Lakes Campsite</h2>
<p>I felt it, but I didn't understand it. Not steady enough to be a locomotive laboring up the pass a few miles north. Too close—slightly the wrong direction. The vibration—felt it more than heard it.  Spun up and down as if laboring—heavy equipment.</p>
<p>Scanned around my campsite assessing my readiness to head out south to Two Medicine Ridge. My cache, two days of food, hung from a tree about forty yards from my tent site. I staged it here on the weekend the Horse Burned.</p>
<p>I laid out watching the stars on this very spot when Vince died.</p>
<p>“Enough!”</p>
<p>At my emotional shout, a startled magpie burst from the tree above screaming a retort.</p>
<p>Christ, got to stop falling into that same goddamn hole.</p>
<p>I had another cache a day east up the ridge to North Half-Dome Craigs.</p>
<p>My adventure laid out before, ready to go—before everything changed—again.</p>
<p>I hefted my pack on my back, wiggled it into position, then drew the straps tighter. The load shifted from my shoulders to resting by friction on my hips.</p>
<p>Once I scrambled from the glacial bowl holding my beloved Bison Lakes, the vibration became clear. Yellow bulldozers—tiny from this distance—chewing a scar across the face of the hillside flesh above the South Fork of the Two-Medicine. A corporate middle finger to the Blackfeet and the National Park System.</p>
<p>They cheated. They didn't have to push through the river canyon, they cut from US2 on Marias Pass, gentler terrain to intercept the river a couple miles west from my ridgeline perch.</p>
<p>This was wilderness—not with a capital W kind—virgin land, protected by no law, just convention. Gotta stop this shit—just pulling stakes didn't make it too expensive explore here.</p>
<p>Later—got business to do first.</p>
<p>My trail, descending into the river valley, started as a deer trail. Turned into just hoofing it across open hillsides.  Not heading toward the bulldozers. Just shortest path down to the river.</p>
<p>Dry alpine country. The summer wildflowers in monochrome drifts before me. Yellow, the main color of July, Arrow Leaf Balsom Root. Looked like good terrain for Bitterroot—I didn't see any—probably too late for this elevation.</p>
<p>As the pitch of my descent increased, my walking cadence shifted to my heels—firm heel strike, traction, stability. Not a rocky canyon, this river cut through old glacial till, sand, gravel, boulders, random mix, moraine.</p>
<p>I grinned hard as I got to the river—not big, but big enough to earn the status of river. The coolest thing, only riverbanks parallel it. No roads. No pipelines. No power-lines.</p>
<p>I stood there listening. Couldn't hear the bulldozers.</p>
<p>The water had calmed a lot since last time I hiked this way. I worked my way upstream until I spotted my crossing point at Mettler Coulee. The boulders, relatively flat topped and roughly evenly spaced, gave me  eleven steps to cross. A month ago, raging whitewater tumbled over them like they weren't there.</p>
<p>Who the fuck was Mettler?</p>
<p>Once across, though, the job became much more difficult. The coulee heading south boxed-up, forcing a zigzag up through the denser trees and undergrowth up onto the shoulder. Took me about forty minutes to get back up into the more open ridge terrain.</p>
<p>Now had to follow along the bare west side of the parallel ridges, cross one perpendicular drainage then hit the ridge on the divide with Hyde Creek. From there it was a straight hike up to Mt Baldy—how many Mt Baldys in the world?</p>
<p>The south side of the bare Mt Baldy blushed with pink flowers. I knew them well, bitterroots. The namesake flower of the Bitterroot Bastards. It didn't appear on the patch, a mass of cock-sucker pink petals emerging directly from the ground. No leaves until later in the summer, but by fall, even they've withered leaving no trace that the underground plant exists.</p>
<p>My camp site sat nestled between boulders below the peak in a draw with a great view east to the morning sun. From the tops of the protective boulders, my final destination beckoned only a few rugged miles on the ridgeline south.</p>
<p>The flat sandy level spot gave me just enough room for my tent. Didn't take long to set it up. My cache of firewood waited patiently under the overhang just above the tent site. Beneath it, I dug up the food cache I'd buried weeks ago.</p>
<p>As night fell, I sat on the highest boulder smoking a joint. The shadow on the front range mountains stretched out, longer and longer, into the land of the Blackfeet, until lost in the haze of the horizon.</p>
<p>I sat near my tiny campfire while I ate the rations that I carried from Bison Lakes in the morning. As darkness fell a few clouds drifted into my sky, I slept inside the tent to get out of the wind.</p>

<h2 id="1985-07-28">1985-07-28</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A small handful, mostly ash gray, but hints of yellow and greenish blue. The smell, sour, like mildew. I tossed the mushroom into my mouth and began to chew. Struggled with it, the urge to spit out grew hard to resist—distraction, just keep hiking.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>With North Half-Dome Craigs firmly in my view I took off up the ridge. No trail here. The trees grew low and gnarled with a pronounced tendency to crowd all their branches to the east—brutal winds tear down the shoulders of the peak to the west.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When I stopped for a break about forty minutes later, I relaxed into the mushroom buzz.  My body amazed me. My legs, levers linked end to end, with my own living meat coordinating the joints to propel this awkward vertical form up the mountain.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I didn’t rest long, I felt compelled to keep the body moving. Living in my body—aware of tiny muscle groups, throughout my body, cooperating to hold my balance while I climbed ever higher up the ridge.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Tripping hard.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I began choosing my path based on which muscles I wanted to feel working. The ridge line did not always ascend. The switch to downhill sections sent shivers through me as different muscle groups automatically took over—didn’t even have to think about it—it just happened.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I couldn’t keep to this ridge, it got too steep. To get to the peak, I had to venture onto the open west face and start zig-zagging upward and a cross the talus. I was bad at it. I kept turning directly upslope in fascination with the sensations of my leg muscles, imaging the bundles of fibers, made of cells responding to nerves.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Talus—crazy stuff to walk on. I filled up with the musical dance of  walking on stacks of dishes. The rocks all became glass shingles, matte ocean glass, flat plates larger than my feet, pastel greens, yellows, blues. I slid and shifted with each step, my balance shifted as my arms shot outward to from my sides. I started to laugh.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A movement caught my eye. I startled to see another person standing, maybe a twenty yards, down slope. He looked up at me. The sun brightened to a glare.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I recognized him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Vince!" I leapt downhill at a run. I slipped and slid on the glass as Vince turned and ran away. "No!  Vince, it's me. Stop!"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I lost my balance and tumbled onto the lichen crusted rocks of the talus. I lay there for a moment looking at the rocks, knowing in my heart that no one ran from me down slope—tripping—not real.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>———> nope, re-work this. It has to be Vince's carnival, not a mining thing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked up, but did not see what I had expected. Just below, an old miner's cabin, the back end completely buried in the rock tumble and gravel. I pulled my self up and with carefully placed steps, descended the slope and round to the front of the decrepit building.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It still had a door. I stepped in, deep dust on the floor, bluish dry mineral smell in the air.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A man and a woman looked up at me as I stepped in. They both erupted in smiles. The guy looked like a miner, dirty clothes, smudges of black coal on his face. She looked like his wife, dressed in an old fashioned gingham dress, checked pink and white.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I knew you eventually come back." The guy stood up from his seat and pulled out a chair for me. I approached cautiously, not sure if I knew him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Beyond the table, I could see out a window, a view down into a valley riddled with the gantries over vertical shaft hard rock mines—hundreds of them. I turned around and looked out the door—like a scene from Butte at the turn of the century, all smoke, and torn up earth—this couldn't happen to the Badger-Two Medicine.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0048" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I took the seat he offered me at the table. His grin became a leer, sexual, animal. The woman held out a deck of cards to me. I took them and witnessed a flash of triumph in her eyes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I began to shuffle and found my self in the box at a poker table. The man on my left and the woman on my right. Five Bastards sat in front of me, Rooster, Slim, Whiskey, Stitch, Acid. I dealt out the hole cards, then the door cards face up.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0050" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Not playing cards, not tarot cards, intricate line drawings with hashed shading and sparse color, depicting miners working. I kept dealing, fourth street, fifth street, no waiting for the players bets. The cards changed as I move through the deck, depict sexual scenes, men and women fucking, men and men fucking, men fucking animals. I dropped the deck on the table.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0051" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The Bastards became crows, exploding from the table into the air. They raised dust as they circled the room and out the door—dusty blue odor and yellow fear.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0052" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I heard my own voice—tiny, distant—like from a deep well. "I'm supposed to be climbing a mountain."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You're s’posed to be ridin’ your own road." Vince sat on my left, his eye meeting mine.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0054" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stuttered. “But, but, you died.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The great maw of the grizzly lunged at me, the smell of mildew, foul breath all brown and dead.  I dropped and rolled on the talus—the clinking of rocks against each other.  I sprawled on the rocks, my face to the sky.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0056" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>No bear, no Vince.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0057" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Gotta turn this around—not the place for a bad trip. Never had mushrooms affect me like this—usually just see patterns, not full on hallucinations. That's an angel dust thing—Gauge's freak out on the night of the Ghost River Clan's fight.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I struggled back to my feet, facing downhill. Pain told me that my right ankle twisted. Looking down, blood trickled down from my left knee—nothing I could do about either now.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0059" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Looking back up to the peak, the talus took on the lobe flow patterns of glacial ice. The whole mountain flowed down into the valley below—a melting candle—no wick, no flame.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0061" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As I ascended, the talus gave way to larger and larger boulders. Ahead, a wall of rock clothed in splotches of black, putty green, and rusty orange lichen—dancing symbols on the rock that I could not read.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0062" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As the rocks got larger and larger toward the peak, I resorted to leaping. Each launch, the feel of the hard muscle, brought me right back to the kickstarter of the rat bike, my final test by the Bastards.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0063" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A full brother for only two months—my time in the Bastards was only two months.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0064" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You never did take to ridin' in formation."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0065" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked around, but did not see Vince.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0066" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I took shelter in cleft between a boulder that barely cleaved to its twin brother. A patch of snow survived in the shade, lightly touched with watermelon pink.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0067" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pulled off my right boot to inspect my paining ankle. Minor swelling, a bit tender to the touch. The left knee, didn't look too bad on close inspection.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0068" style="color: #c57a00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A pika, alpine rock rabbit, scampered into the open, froze, staring at me with beady black eyes, then vanished back under the rocks.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0070" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I edged around the highest boulder looking for the route up.  Only the south side gave me access, but with a trap. A dizzying shear headwall opened in front of me, a thousand foot drop into a cirque with a turquoise glacier lake.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0071" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The path to the top took a steep crumbled crack just up from the precipice. I looked for the foot and hand holds—sketchy—tripping, not sure of my judgement. The fall line, down the chute and over the edge.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0072" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Nope, can't get to the very top.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0073" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I wasn't disappointed. Not as if twenty feet made much difference in the view. I gazed south to the open maw of the South Craigs cirque. The ridge line extended two miles, a link between the two peaks—could be hikable—not my path right now.</p>
