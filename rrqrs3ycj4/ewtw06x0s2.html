            <h2 id="TheRide">The Ride</h2>
<p>I left my cabin a couple of hours after sunrise for the ride down to Heart Butte: a clear midsummer morning full of potential. I took the cutoff road, turned a bit too enthusiastically, swinging into the oncoming lane, thankfully empty. I checked my speed and continued, my excitement for today's ride undeterred. Today would be another record long ride for my first summer on a motorcycle: over six hours on the asphalt in grand loop around the famed Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex, one and a half million acres of roadless mountains.</p>
<p>I arrived at David's cabin precisely on time. David came out his front door to greet me. "Morning, Karl. How's the ride down?"</p>
<p>"Uneventful. Not a single car on Heart Butte Cutoff the whole way down."</p>
<p>"You want some coffee?"</p>
<p>"Sure." I walked into his cabin. He gestured at the machine and set his cup beside it. He walked away. My eyes twitched to the empty coffee machine and then back to him as he sat down at the table. Since I had never made coffee in my life, it took nearly ten minutes to make two of the foulest cups I’ve ever tasted. David, not noticing, unnecessarily recapped the day's plan for me. I had already mapped it on my highway map, and traced every curve in my collection of USGS topographic maps.</p>
<p>We would ride down to Montana 200 via Augusta, then swing around the southern wilderness border on Roger's Pass. From there, we'd head back north through the Swan Valley and into the expansive Flathead Valley. The destination was Vince's Iron Horse, a biker bar in Columbia Falls where David wanted to spend an evening playing poker, then hire a woman for the night. Tomorrow, we'd swing through Glacier National Park over Going to the Sun Road and back to our respective homes.</p>
<p>David arranged the ride with an old Army acquaintance from the Vietnam War, a retired officer. He lived in Augusta, about an hour and a half south of David's place. He'd join us on the highway about noon. Originally, David had not invited me on this ride, saying I did not have the skill. I insisted I could prove my endurance. He relented long before I exhausted my arguments in my favor, probably just to get me to shut up.</p>
<p>He drained his coffee cup without comment on its quality. "Give me the blow job now. I won't need it tonight."</p>
<p>"Anytime or anywhere you want it." I hadn’t expected it, but I complied eagerly.</p>
<p>He nodded, stood up, and repositioned himself on the sofa, unbuttoning his pants but leaving just the fly open and the waist unbuttoned in his usual manner. I knelt in front of him, my own dick tenting my jeans, and deftly performed my duty.</p>
<p>This time, I discreetly opened my own pants and worked myself while sucking him. He leaned his head back with his eyes closed. When he started to buck and squirt, it tipped me over the edge, and my own load squirted onto the leg of his riding pants. With both of us finished, he  got up and attended to his final chores for the ride. I said nothing about my drying spunk on his leg. He didn’t notice.</p>
<p>He left a twenty-dollar bill on the table for me.</p>
<p>Another ten minutes later, David locked his door, we mounted the bikes, and pointed south.</p>
<p>US89 South parallels the front range of the Rockies about twenty miles out. The mountains just suddenly rise from the plains without discernible foothills, an artifact of the Lewis Overthrust fault. Millions of years ago, as the Bitterroot Batholith lifted the land during an era named the Laramide Orogeny, the crust fractured along long north-south lines. As the tipping increased, the fragments shifted and slid over the top of each other like fanning a deck of cards in the hands of a skilled dealer. Each parallel mountain range crowds against the next as if struggling to see the eastward view over the shoulders of the neighbors.</p>
<p>I had a difficult time dividing my attention between the mountain view sliding by, and concentrating on my own survival on the road. This highway had potholes.</p>
<p>Ninety minutes later, we pulled into a driveway in Augusta, where a Harley FLT Tour Glide sat packed and poised for a trip: a  two-wheeled car without doors, a roof, or seat belts. Harley's answer to the invading Asian hoard of Honda Gold Wings.</p>
<p>As we pulled in, a large man with a bushy gray beard, gray nub of a ponytail, and a protruding beer belly stepped from the shade of the garage. David parked and greeted the man like old friends, though without an embrace. I noticed the handshake, the hand-to-wrist clasp that David had shown me on the day of our first ride two months ago.</p>
<p>I stood a few paces behind David as if I were his attendant awaiting a task. David and his friend talked animatedly, David blocking my view of him. After a few moments, the guy leaned to the side, peering around David to see me. His movement reminded David of my existence. David gave an oddly one way introduction, he told his friend my name, but didn't tell me the friend's name. To my chagrin, David then reverted to calling me "kid", a diminutive he used, I supposed, to impress upon his friend that I was a mere camp follower and not an actual friend.</p>
<p>His friend ribbed David by saying, “About time you got yourself a boy."</p>
<p>David recoiled. "Oh, you fuck off."</p>
<p>The guy roared a great loud laugh that could have been heard a block away. I frowned. He stepped up to me, saying, "Don't take shit from him. I'm Ted." He proffered his hand, and we did that same biker handshake. He looked at me for a moment with a slightly puzzled expression. “Have we met before?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so."</p>
<p>Ted shrugged. “So what’re you ridin’?”</p>
<p>He stepped past me to take a look. “Honda CX five-hunnerd—Dee-lux model.”</p>
<p>No judgment in his tone—none of David’s sneer. He got down on the driveway for a closer look and a proper once-over.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"She’s got real potential. Transverse V-twin, jugs pointin’ up and out both sides. Shaft drive. Dunno about that." He looked up to me. "Harley's movin' to belts. Lord, I hope they know what they're doin'"</p>
<p>He ran a calloused hand along the frame near the radiator, then glanced up. “You ever think about choppin’ her?”</p>
<p>"I'm a  computer guy. I don’t do hardware."</p>
<p>Ted grinned. “Well, hell, you could always hire someone. I know some boys in Missoula could turn her into a real looker. Rake out that front fork. Really give her some presence, turn some heads."</p>
<p>"It's borrowed. I don't own it. Someday, I'll have my own bike."</p>
<p>He nodded, a little disappointed. “Ah. Too bad. How’s she do on the highway?”</p>
<p>"It's shaky over 70. I suspect tires, but otherwise fine."</p>
<p>That got him moving. He dropped into a crouch, squinting at the tread. "Yeah, these’ve seen some miles." He looked up at me with a fatherly frown. "Replace ’em soon. Don’t push your luck."</p>
<p>Like flipping a switch, he  smiled again. “I hear you and David’re out ridin’ most weekends. Bet you’re right on his ass in the curves, huh?”</p>
<p>"Yes" I hesitated puzzled. “How do you know?"</p>
<p>I caught a glimpse of David scowling.</p>
<p>"She's made for carving up curves. Harley cruiser design doesn't hold a candle to this bike for that. Not even close. Long haul, though, yeah, I bet this girl's not so great. Probably fine for a young guy like you, but she'd torture an old fart like me.”</p>
<p>He turned and looked me over as if inspecting me like he did the bike. "You really need to get some proper gear. If you ever lay her down, you're going to road rash down to the bone."</p>
<p>Just then, a gray-haired woman, about sixty, emerged from the garage to greet David. "Howdy, Maggie. You're not riding along today?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, this is the men’s ride. I'm staying home to have the house to myself for a couple of days." She laughed. “Besides, my boyfriend will through that door not three minutes after you men leave town."</p>
<p>Ted laughed his great guffaw again. "She's always threatening to trade me in for a new model. Let’r try, I don't mind. If she keeps making me dinner, she can do whatever she wants."</p>
<p>I couldn't tell if he joked or not.</p>
<p>"Maggie, c’mere. Come meet Karl."</p>
<p>She stepped up to me, offering a normal handshake.</p>
<p>"Oh, look at those tattoos. Let me see the forearm tree. That's wonderful, so unusual. Where did you have that done?"</p>
<p>"Missoula."</p>
<p>"That's not Ben's work. Ben did most of Ted's tattoos. What parlor?"</p>
<p>"Maggie," Ted cut in gesturing to me. "Karl's out here ridin' in a jean jacket and—what are those, gardening gloves?” Ted shook his head, then grinned. “You remember that Langlitz jacket and pants I picked up in Portland? What was it, ‘62? Bet they’d fit him.”</p>
<p>"Oh! I saw that box last week when clearing for my sewing room. I tossed them in the Goodwill pile for next time we're in Helena."</p>
<p>She turned and walked back into the house.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, she came up from the basement with a cardboard box. Ted opened it and pulled out the jacket and the leather pants stiff with age.</p>
<p>"Langlitz." He held them up like a treasure. "Oh, these been sittin’ too long.”</p>
<p>Maggie wiped them down with a cloth, then held the jacket up to me, sizing it up. "This looks like a good fit. Try it on."</p>
<p>I slid into it. The sleeves drooped nearly past my hands. "Well, seems kinda too long in the arms, and too short at the waist."</p>
<p>“Get on your bike.” She commanded me as if she were my superior officer. I complied without hesitation.</p>
<p>I mounted up and reached for the bars. The sleeves slid back into perfect alignment at my wrists.</p>
<p>"See?" Maggie smiled.  "That's how they're supposed to fit.  The short waist was the style back then. You're a classic now."</p>
<p>I pulled it off reluctantly. "It’s nice, but I really can’t afford..."</p>
<p>"That's not the idea, dear."</p>
<p>Ted wandered back over from talking with David.  "Son, if they fit you, they are yours. No good to anybody in a box. I sure as hell can’t squeeze into ’em anymore.” He laughed loudly again, while patting his belly. "My son, Mike, doesn't ride, and he’s built like a beer barrel too."</p>
<p>David shoved in, "Hate to interrupt your garage sale, but let’s get on the goddamn highway."</p>
<p>Ted turned to David with a frown. "Hold your throttle—this won't take long."</p>
<p>Maggie led me inside to change. The leather creaked with every movement.</p>
<p>Once fully outfitted with my first riding leathers, she used the cloth to buff off some dust I didn't see. "These will do for this ride, but when you get home, you need to get some leather dressing on these. They've been in a box for years and they are dry, dry, dry. I'm afraid they'll crack." She looked me over, like a military inspection.</p>
<p>I straightened my posture.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, we rolled out of the driveway, Ted leading, David following, and I took the rear.  We rolled around to the gas station on the other side of the block to fill our tanks. I didn't need to add much, but David added several gallons. I got out my wallet to pay, but Ted stopped me, "You don't need that."</p>
<p>"Oh, you don't have to pay for my gas. You've already given me these leathers."</p>
<p>“Karl, I own this station. Got five more—one up in Choteau, four along I-15 north of Great Falls. You roll into any of ‘em on your bike, you don’t pay. Simple as that.”</p>
<p>Ted remounted his bike while David came over to speak to me, holding the flask from his jacket's inner pocket, "I want you to stay a half mile to a mile behind us."</p>
<p>"What? Why?" Am I exiled from the group?</p>
<p>"435 ahead is twisty. Don't want you crowding us on the curves." He took a long draw from the flat shiny metal flask and slipped back into his jacket. "You'll have a better time way behind us."</p>
<p>I stared at him a moment. He made some sense, but I still suspected that he just didn't want to be seen with me. My eyes dropped to the gas stained concrete while I gave a resigned, "Ok."</p>
<p>I guess he was right. I ended up having a lot of fun on MT435, but I repeatedly caught up with them and then had to fall back. Then we switched to MT200, the road straightened out except for the few wider curves of Rogers Pass.</p>
<p>We made a brief stop in Lincoln, I assumed so that David could take a pull on his flask. David warned me, "More curves ahead. Hang back. Remember to turn onto 83 at the big cow sculpture."</p>
<p>"David, I grew up around thirty miles west of here, I remember the cow sculpture from when I was a kid. I know where we’re going." He scowled at me. Why does he keep treating me like an idiot?</p>
<p>For the next forty minutes, I hung miles back, riding by myself, just like most of my rides. I could feel the frown hanging on my face. What was the point of this ride if I didn't get to ride with them? I didn't even try to catch up until well after the turn onto MT83 at Clearwater Junction.</p>
<p>I rolled the throttle up to just under the bike's uncomfortable vibration range, and ate up the miles to the town of Seeley Lake. I spotted them in the parking lot at the Moose River Bar. I pulled into the lot as they pushed through the front door. Ted paused to wave to me from the doorway.</p>
<p>Not even any room to park with them—after finding my own spot, I just sat on the bike for a couple minutes sulking. Took me a while to get over myself. I joined them at the bar, pointedly choosing a seat next to Ted with David on the far side.</p>
<p>Ted turned to me as I sat. "David stopped me from setting you up with a beer. He said you wouldn't drink it. You in AA?"</p>
<p>"Nope, I've never been a drinker, probably never will be."</p>
<p>"I've not met many people that don't drink that aren't AA, holy rollers, or a Mormon. You don't look like a roller or a Mormon."</p>
<p>“A doctor told me my liver’s got trouble. Maybe hepatitis when I was a kid. I can't hold alcohol. One beer hits me like a whole six pack. I feel real sick real quick.”</p>
<p>Ted nodded slowly. “Yeah, that’s rough. Fitting in matters, especially at your age.” Ted paused for a moment, thinking. “Easy fix, though—just grab an empty beer bottle. Pour your 7-Up in it. Nobody’ll look twice.”</p>
<p>I sat silent for more than a moment rolling the idea in my head. Sure, why not? Just like I hide everything else about my life. "Yeah, I guess that could work."</p>
<p>David jumped in from the other side of Ted. "You didn't think of it yourself 'cause you're not drunk enough to come up with the lie."</p>
<p>Ted's thunder-laugh hit again.</p>
<p>When Ted finished his bottle of Olympia, he offered it to me. “Here’s your bottle. Rinse it out and dry it off, and always take it with you. Unless you'd rather have David's Rainier."</p>
<p>I took the bottle. "Thank you." Sure, let's just toss another lie onto the pile.</p>
<p>We continued on north through the glacier-carved Swan Valley. I didn't hang back this time—defied David, riding close enough to taste the tang of oil in his exhaust.</p>
<p>The highway follows a chain of lakes, curving between the Mission Mountains on the west and the Swan Range on the east. The Swans rose in single long jagged façade, marking the western edge of the Bob Marshall Wilderness.</p>
<p>The ride should’ve been pure joy—sky, mountains, and summer air. But every time the mountains took my breath away, I’d look around at what should have been dense forests and felt my my chest tighten. The timber industry stripped this valley to the bone. Clearcuts ran right up to the lake shores. Some of the land had been carved up sold off as cabin lots, the rest left to erode. The forest wouldn’t come back in my lifetime.</p>
<p>The Mission Mountains on the west side, tall and rugged to the south, diminished rapidly in stature northward. By the time we got to the town of Big Fork, where the Swan River joins Flathead Lake, the mountain range just disappears into the earth.</p>
<p>After two more unnecessary stops at bars to sate David's constant need for beer, we rolled into the Glacier View Motor Lodge in the late afternoon. Heading into the office, we found out they had only two rooms left.</p>
<p>David quickly pointed at me. "I'm not bunking with him."</p>
<p>Ted turned to me and said, "I hope you don't mind my snoring, ‘cause it’s as loud as my laugh." Right on cue, he let one rip.</p>
<p>David booked the last single room while Ted and I took the double. They unloaded their gear into the rooms. I just left everything in my saddlebags, thinking I'd grab stuff as I needed it. Both David and Ted announced naps before dinner—gonna have a late night at the poker tables. I had no interest in sleeping.</p>
<p>As the motel sat right near the Flathead River, I took the opportunity to scope out Columbia Falls’ namesake falls. Even after an hour of walking, I never found them.</p>
<h2 id="PokeratVince'sIronHorse">Poker at Vince's Iron Horse</h2>
<p>Later that evening, after a truly exceptional steak dinner at the new Grouse Mountain Lodge in Whitefish, we rode back to Columbia Falls to a bar near the railroad tracks: Vince's Iron Horse.</p>
<p>Thirty or so motorcycles lined up along the building's front wall like a line of carefully arranged dominoes, except with a pronounced lean. The neon sign blazed over the door in the shape of a motorcycle gang patch: the top rocker, in red neon, saying, "Vince's"; the center emblem, a blue and gold motorcycle with a long raked-out fork; the bottom rocker, also in red neon, read "Iron Horse". Though the sky still faded from the sunset an hour ago, the piercing light of the sign painted the asphalt and reflections sparkled from the line of heavy chromed bikes.</p>
<p>Ted and David pulled in ahead of me, swung around, and then pushed themselves backwards into spaces next to a couple of absurdly raked-out Harleys.</p>
<p>When I started my own parking maneuver, David waved his arms at me to stop. He approached, pointing down to the other end of the line of bikes. "You park down there with those Gold Wings." The fucker—just wanted to demoralize me. I sullenly complied, anger seething in my chest.</p>
<p>Ted and David didn't wait. They disappeared into the bar before I even got off my bike. I suppose having me park way down at the end saved David the indignity of walking in with a Honda rider.</p>
<p>I pulled the door open and stepped into a wall of noise and music. The bouncer at the door—huge, with Dolph stretched across his black tank top—looked me up and down. Finding nothing wrong, an upward nod. I slipped by him into the cloud of cigarette and cigar smoke.</p>
<p>A busty woman carrying a tray of pitchers wheeled around me. I stepped deeper into the crowd: three-quarters men, one-quarter women. The hypermasculinity felt like a drug: the beards, the muscles, the skin, the hair, the ink—did I die on the road and enter Valhalla?</p>
<p>Scanning the crowd toward the bar. I caught a raised hand—Ted. His grin gave me an anchor. I threaded through the throng, reveling in the heady odor of sweat, beer, smoke, and just an occasional whiff of pot. Why were men like this never queer? How could they not be? Why did all of this go straight to my crotch?</p>
<p>At the bar Ted called through the din, “You got your bottle?"</p>
<p>I pulled it from my inside pocket. He snatched it and a glass of ginger ale from the bar, deftly decanted it into my bottle with one smooth pour. David watched with a disapproving eye. Ted handed the bottle to me, grabbed his own beer from the bar, and held it up in a toast. We clinked bottles, then he and David did the same.</p>
<p>David turned from the bar, saying just "Poker," ignoring my raised bottle.</p>
<p>As David moved, a gap opened—and there he was. The bartender— tattooed, hugely muscled, dark beard with a few rogue gray strands. He wore a black tank top emblazoned with the word, "Boss". My gaze froze on the knotty scar spanning from the gray at the hairline above his right temple to the middle of his right eyebrow. Just for a moment, his attention turned to me. We locked eyes. He gave me an upward nod, then turned away.</p>
<p>An electric shiver flashed up my back. Goddamn he was beautiful.</p>
<p>I followed Ted and David through a short passage that dog legged behind the bar to the card room. Decorated with detritus of dead motorcycles, license plates, and old gas station signs, the room had a stained, smooth concrete floor revealing it once had been an actual working garage. Three large garage doors, big enough for large trucks, made up the back wall.</p>
<p>The music, significantly subdued in comparison to the main bar, allowed for the dealers and players to hear each other clearly. There appeared to be ten poker tables, but only six of them running at this moment. The disused ones had table tops covering the felt for use by customers seeking a quieter space than the main bar.</p>
<p>Dave turned and glared at me as we approach the tables. "You’re not ready for this. You're out of your league."</p>
<p>"I know how to play poker." I let the anger show in my voice.</p>
<p>"You're going to lose your money. Don’t come crying that I didn't warn you."</p>
<p>We scored spots at a five-seat table, two seats already occupied. The dealer, a wiry man in his early forties, wore an immaculately trimmed beard with sharp, precise edges. His black tank top shirt had "Dealer" and "Chris" printed on both the front and the back. His heavily tattooed arms displayed a gambling theme: dice pairs that added to seven, snake eyes, and box cars. There were several poker hands I recognized: the Dead Man's hand, two pair, aces over eights; the Steel Wheel, flush ace to five; the Bug Hand, five of a kind aces employing a joker.</p>
<p>Every dealer in the room wore a similar black shirt with their name. No buttoned-down white collars here. At the Oxford in Missoula, we wore bow ties. Here, tattoos, muscle, or cleavage ran every card table. Anyone in long sleeves probably lacked the biker bona fides.</p>
<p>To the dealer's left sat a bald guy with a large gold earring and lots of muddy tattoos, probably in his late fifties. I glanced at his chips—exactly one seventy-two. My dealer’s eye hadn’t dulled in the two years off the felt.</p>
<p>Next to him sat an older woman, probably in her sixties with dyed hair piled up in a style out of the early seventies. Her chips piled as neatly as her hairdo—two hundred forty-seven. A cigarette smoldered in her ashtray like an incense stick. I imagined her punching keys at the checkout register at a local grocery store.</p>
<p>The order of their stacks, the calm in their posture—they were both seasoned players, not tourists.</p>
<p>Ted slid in next to the lady, she smiled a wide grin crowded with crooked, smoke-stained teeth. "I'm Sheila, and this is Dale," nodding to the bald man. Dale glanced up and grunted.</p>
<p>Ted introduced himself and then said, "David and Karl," gesturing to us, and we took our seats. I sat next to the dealer, on his right, and David filled out the table between Ted and me.</p>
<p>I really liked these small five player tables—lot more personal—easier to track what's happening.</p>
<p>The dealer looked over his three new players. “Hundred-dollar minimum buy-in, gentlemen."</p>
<p>Both Ted and David bought in for three hundred.</p>
<p>I blanched. I knew I didn't have that much to my name. "What are the betting limits here?"</p>
<p>The dealer answered. "Any limits in here, you brought in yourself."</p>
<p>Heavy sigh—I gotta go all in. The wad of disorganized bills I pulled from my pocket embarrassed me. I unfold some, smoothed out the crumples of others and counted them out for the dealer. I bought in at two hundred eighty-seven.</p>
<p>Ted's furrowed brow demonstrated his concern that I bought in over my head. He didn't say anything.</p>
<p>I knew nothing of how Ted and David played, but I made some educated guesses. Ted just wanted to have fun; he would treat his chips like popcorn at the movies. David likely fancied himself some kind of poker sharp, but I’ve seen how he thought—his game would be all ego and emotion.</p>
<p>I took the obvious plan—none of them knew my history as a card dealer. I would play novice. I carefully counted my tokes like it hurt to have them on the table all exposed and vulnerable. I sighed and I leaned over to David as if confiding. "If I lose my gas money, will you help me get home?" I made sure my voice carried to the table.</p>
<p>"Hell, no."</p>
<p>Ted looked at David with a frown, then caught my eye, and gave a subtle nod. I nodded back. David didn't notice.</p>
<p>I fidgeted in my chair. I kept touching my chips as if I was afraid they'd run away.</p>
<p>The dealer shuffled in my peripheral vision with practiced precision. I made no eye contact with anyone.</p>
<p>"Let's begin. Ma’am," nodding to Shiela, then swept his gaze around the table. "Gentlemen." He reached over the table and moved the button to Ted. "The small blind is to you, sir", addressing David.</p>
<p>David pushed out a one-dollar chip. "And the big blind to you, sir," nodding to me. I looked around like I didn't know what to do.</p>
<p>Ted stepped in to save me. "Put two dollars out."</p>
<p>I feigned a startle and push two chips out.</p>
<p>"Blinds are up, we begin with the hole card deal." The cards came out quick and clean—once around, then again.</p>
<p>I watched everyone discreetly lift up the corners of their cards. Then, in performing my chosen role, I just picked up my cards to look at them full face: 4♦ and 9♣. A trash hand start, nothing to build on here, good omen. I looked at them for a while and then set them abruptly back down, as if I had just noticed that everyone stared at me.</p>
<p>The dealer turned his focus to Dale, who immediately said, "call" and pushed out two chips.</p>
<p>Sheila pushed ten out. "Raise."</p>
<p>Ted called. David raised.</p>
<p>I paused, acting unsure and then folded. The game proceeded with me out of the action as I watched how they played. Sheila was a bold player. David, of course, unnecessarily jumped out of the gate running too hot.  Sheila took the pot, the dealer pushed way more to her than her hand deserved.</p>
<p>First game in and David's already down cash.</p>
<p>I folded early in each of the next two hands.</p>
<p>Ted leaned past David. "Son, you're going to have to start playing the game eventually." He sounded sorry for me.</p>
<p>Perfect. I gave him a wide eyed lost-puppy stare.</p>
<p>Sheila fixed her gaze at me from across the table. "That's a really pretty earring, honey. You get that down at that place on the reservation in Ronan?"</p>
<p>"No, Blackfeet Reservation, Browning," I said.</p>
<p>"You know that's a ladies' earring, don't you?"</p>
<p>She smiled but I could hear the teeth behind it. I retorted, "No, it's my earring."</p>
<p>The dealer snorted, then interrupted the banter by starting the next round.</p>
<p>Time to let them all take a bite. I played the hand, deliberately sloppy, and lost. I furrowed my brow and frowned.</p>
<p>When the hand completed, Sheila blurted out, gesturing to me, “He’s the mark."</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>They all came for me on the next round, with the exception of Ted, each one dangling their own bait. I took it all—called too much, folded too late, flinched at all the wrong times—let them think they got me pegged.</p>
<p>Having laid my own bait, I floundered through another few hands, waiting for the deal to favor me.</p>
<p>With his mechanical precision, the dealer shuffled and dealt out the hole cards. This time I held the button, my position of power. I peeked at my cards, K♠, Q♠, letting my brow furrow, knowing that Sheila, the hawk, watched me from across the table.</p>
<p>Dale put in the small blind, Sheila put in the big blind. Ted opened the bet with fifteen. David raised it to twenty.</p>
<p>I called the twenty, as did Dale and Sheila.</p>
<p>The dealer burned the top card and announced "the flop," flipping the first community cards: 10♠, J♠, 4♦</p>
<p>As flops go, this was perfect, a classic “come hand”. I had both an open-ended straight draw and a flush draw—I had outs in every direction, three ways to hit a major hand and even more ways for a lesser one—this could be over at the turn. This called for the slow play.</p>
<p>Dale opened the bet with $10. Sheila raised to $20.</p>
<p>Ted folded.</p>
<p>David called.</p>
<p>I counted out the twenty with fives and ones. “Uh, yeah, I’ll call.”  Knocked the stack over as I pushed it out to the pot.</p>
<p>The dealer burned another card, then announcing and revealing the turn: A♠.</p>
<p>I hit the nut flush—the strongest possible hand on the board. Now it was all about extracting as much as I could from David or anyone else that dared to stay in this game.</p>
<p>Dale started again with the same $10 opening. Just like with the Flop, Sheila raised to twenty.</p>
<p>David, confident, raised it to $30. "Let's see if this kid's got balls." He turned to look at me.</p>
<p>I frowned and glanced at him. Yeah, I got the balls—the proof dried on David’s pant leg early this morning.  He’d pay me a second time for it, too. Time to steam him up and look reckless at the same time.</p>
<p>I counted out and shoved chips out fast. “Raise to $75" I glared at him. "Stop calling me kid."</p>
<p>David, incredulous, squinted at me. He looked at my messy pile of chips, then back at the table.</p>
<p>Dale fidgeted, frowned, and gazed over at David and me.  Pushed his call out to the pot while watching us. I got my first hook in.</p>
<p>Sheila's eyes gleamed like she spotted easy money. She followed our drama on the far side of the table with glee. I got the second hook.</p>
<p>It came back around to David, “Fine. Call.” He pushed out his forty-five. I got the best hook in.</p>
<p>The dealer burned a final card and flipped over the river: 10♥. It might as well have been a blank card as far as I cared—it didn't change anything in my life.</p>
<p>Dale looked at the table with suspicion, then focused on David and me in turn—his brow said he regretted that last call. He shook his head, cut his loss and folded. Slipped the hook, but I got a slice of his stacks.</p>
<p>Sheila, mesmerized with the feud across the table, opened with a $50 bet.</p>
<p>David smirked, looking at me, “you've got only about seventy bucks left. You wanna stay in the game, you're gotta go all in. You can fuckin' walk back to the Rez.”</p>
<p>He raised to seventy.</p>
<p>I hesitated and then shoved out all the rest of my chips. "I've been pretty much all in with you since we met."</p>
<p>Sheila, looked across at me. "Oh, honey, you don't know what you're doing.” She pushed out her call, throwing her money at the soap opera.</p>
<p>As there were no more deals, Sheila started the showdown.</p>
<p>She flipped over 4♣, 4♥ using the 4♦ from the Flop. She grinned at us.</p>
<p>She had only a set—barely enough to beat two pair. She's just paying to see our show—it's not over yet, lady.</p>
<p>David flipped over his cards like a slap across my face: A♥,10♦ combined with flop, the turn, and the river he earned full house—tens over aces—a really strong hand in any game but this one.</p>
<p>I watched Sheila's grin crash—just a side show.</p>
<p>I started to laugh. It went on and on until David finally yelled at me. "Turn over your damn cards!"</p>
<p>I flipped them: K♠, Q♠. My nut flush silenced the table.</p>
<p>David now played the deer in the headlights role. I knocked him right off the road, down the embankment, and into the river. He just stared at my hole cards as if he couldn't figure out what they meant.</p>
<p>Ted's laugh exploded. He got it. Heads turned across the cardroom.</p>
<p>That's when David realized what happened. "Holy fuck!" He glanced at my grin and turned his back to me.</p>
<p>Sheila showed me a forced pursed smile.</p>
<p>The dealer raked the pot to me—took me a bit to get it organized. I had kept a chaotic pile for all previous games, I switched to neat organized stacks—more than seven hundred dollars.</p>
<p>I covertly watched David as I sorted my chips. With his back still to me I couldn't hear what he muttered. Thought I heard that name Derick again—didn't press him on it.</p>
<p>Dale retired from the table. A tall man—clearly from the Salish tribe—took his place. He didn’t say his name.</p>
<p>When the waitress came around to me, I ordered a shot of whiskey—for David.</p>
<p>We started playing the next hand. David played stunned, missed opportunities, made bad raises. Heart and mind somewhere far away from the felt.</p>
<p>For the next half hour, I took hands and lost hands. This was my new job. I needed to take home enough cash to live for a while. Good poker is really just economics—play the patterns in the trends across a bunch of games, specific games rarely matter—maximize the wins on good hands, minimize the losses of the bad hands. The profit just follows on.</p>
<p>After several hands in a row where I steadily routed his chips into my stacks, Ted turned to look me in the eye. “You’ve been hustling us the whole time, haven't you?"</p>
<p>"Maybe." I grinned.</p>
<p>"Where'd you learn to play poker like this?"</p>
<p>"Oh, you call this tunnel vision Texas line dance, poker?" I paused, not expecting an answer. "It's just a game show. It turns dealers into Vanna White flipping over letters. It deserves a laugh track."</p>
<p>The dealer chuckled.</p>
<p>Ted turned to David, "Shall we cash out before this guy fleeces us down to our shorts?"</p>
<p>David barked an angry, “fuck.”</p>
<p>Still wouldn't look at me.</p>
<p>I nodded to Ted. "I'm gonna stick around here for a while. I gotta get money to buy new tires for the bike."</p>
<p>They cashed out. As David stood up to leave, he revealed that the shot of whiskey I bought for him sat untouched.</p>
<p>"We'll be at the pool tables with our remaining quarters or maybe we'll try a nice safe game of pinball." Ted smiled at me. "Karl, that was beautiful—I'm gonna tell this story for years. I'm sorry Maggie missed it."</p>
<p>I nodded, turning back to the felt. A couple of new players joined to fill out the table. The following games didn't stress me. I settled back into the groove of the game. Like taking curves on the bike, it's all about reading the road and riding the sidewalls.</p>
<p>Sheila cashed out before I could bust her.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, I noticed that Ted returned to watch. Sheila stood next to him, quietly talking and watching the table.</p>
<p>The Salish guy—still never got his name—was the other good player at the table. Each time the weak cards came, I ensured my contribution to his take stayed low. Some hands can’t win.</p>
<p>Both of us pulled cash from the three tourists that spoke with southern drawls. They were just paying for the show. They'll take the story home with them, they played poker in Montana with an Indian and a biker.</p>
<p>Overall, I prevailed. I took way more money off the table than he did, more than I needed to bridge a couple months of food, gas and rent. I could get the tires, too.</p>
<p>The tourists tapped out, headed to the cashier to save what they had left. I requested a cash out, too, and the dealer racked my chips.</p>
<p>I noted the tourists didn't tip the dealer. "I'm sorry. I pretty much wiped out your toke. This oughta cover it." I pushed 150 in tokes to him.</p>
<p>The dealer broke into a wide grin, saying in an overly formal way, "Thank you, sir. It was a pleasure to watch you work this evening." He handed me my racks.</p>
<p>Only the Salish guy hung on to face four new players. I nodded to him as I left the table.</p>
<p>Sheila intercepted me before I took five steps. With her cigarette-husky voice, she said, “Honey, you had me buffaloed—looked so scared. You even distracted me with that earring."</p>
<p>She shook her head and pasted on a manufactured smile. "By the way, I still like it. I like the look on a man. You just keep wearin' it."</p>
<p>That came off as a threat—like there would be consequences ahead for me. Her gray eyes bored into mine—even I could see the challenge.</p>
<p>Ted stepped up to me. "Seriously, gotta know how you learned to play like that."</p>
<p>"Walk with me to the cashier." I kept talking as I walked. "I'm the youngest son of a card-playing lawyer. I've been playing since I was five. I dealt cards at the Ox in Missoula on the weekends to get through college. I read the book and watched how the good players do it. Dealing paid for my books, tuition, and food."</p>
<p>"The Oxford? That's where I recognized you from. On my driveway this morning, I just knew I had seen you before. I'm dead sure Maggie and I sat at your table. Wait until I tell her."</p>
<p>"Sorry, I didn't recognize you. I saw a lot of people and spent most of my time concentrating on managing the game. I've been off the felt for about two years."</p>
<p>We walked back down the hall to the main bar. "Where's David?"</p>
<p>"Over there on the other side of the pool tables." He gestured to the far side of the room. "I think he's talking up a hooker."</p>
<p>"Oh, good for him. Getting laid ought do him some good."</p>
<p>We took a couple of seats at the bar. Didn't see that big guy with the Boss shirt and the scar. I bought Ted an Oly and we started talking.</p>
<p>Ted told me of his experience in logistics during the Vietnam War while stationed in Hawaii's Fort Shafter.  He worked on the distribution of mechanical supplies, spare parts, and repair tools for Army equipment having engines. When he retired out of the service, he and Maggie relocated to Augusta, Montana, where they bought out the garage and gas station.</p>
<p>Eventually, the conversation returned to David. "So, you and David make kind of an odd pair. I've not figured out what's going on. Seems, well, out of character for him to have befriended you. You willing to tell me what's going on?"</p>
<p>"I do not know why he keeps inviting me out on rides. He's constantly critical of me, my bike, and just about everything I do. Maybe I'm attracted to the criticism as that's all I ever heard in my life.  Affinity of the outcast, perhaps."</p>
<p>"And how are you an outcast?"</p>
<p>I shrugged and sighed heavily. "God, I hate repeating this story over and over. I am the black sheep in a family of overachievers. We'll save this for another time, not here, not in this place."</p>
<p>"Fair enough. I just feel I need to warn you about David. He had a really rough time in 'Nam and even more afterwards. Has he told you about it?"</p>
<p>"No, not a word."</p>
<p>"Well, really, that's his story to tell. I'll just say he's got a lot of anger in him. I think he did some time for assault. He hurt his wife pretty bad. Be careful. He didn't like what you did at the poker table. Tread lightly, son."</p>
<p>"Did I take his hooker money?"</p>
<p>"I doubt it." Ted looked over beyond the pool tables. David and the woman were gone.</p>
<p>We were silent for a while, and Ted stood up. "It's pushing one in the morning. I'm an old man, and I think I'm gonna to call it a night. How about you?"</p>
<p>"I'm going to stick around for a while." I didn't want to spend a sleepless night listening to Ted snoring.</p>
<p>"Well, have a good night." He turned and headed for the door. As he approached, he suddenly turned around and caught my eye. He made an exaggerated head movement as his way of pointing to a group of three women sitting at a table together. God, he was the anti-David. He pointed out some women that he thought ought to interest me.</p>
<p>I laughed and gave him a dismissive wave.</p>
<p>The crowd had thinned significantly. I walked back to the card room. There was only one table still running. Wondering what I was going to do, I turned around and found myself nearly face to face with the dealer from the table earlier.</p>
<p>"Hey there. I'm Chris. Your dealer from earlier tonight."</p>
<p>"Chris, yes, of course I recognize you. I'm Karl."</p>
<p>“Watchin’ you work that table tonight made my day. You had it locked down the second you sat down. Thought you were gettin’ chewed up ‘til I caught on. Even Sheila—Sheila of all people—called you the mark. She don’t get fooled easy. But you sold it, and you took the whole table for a ride.”</p>
<p>"Beginners luck, I guess."</p>
<p>“Oh, don't feed me that line. The whole nervous act? Chip fumbling, folding clean hands—textbook playing weak to bait. You let yourself bleed chips early, then hit the nuts and squeezed max value. That’s not luck, Karl. I’m playing a hunch here. Where were you in the box?”</p>
<p>“Box?” I feigned.</p>
<p>“That crack about ‘Texas line dance poker’? The whole Vanna White bit? You’re not talking like a player, you’re talking like a card pitcher. Then after you practically routed the table, you apologized to me for ruining the toke and then made it right. Only a guy that’s been in the box would do that.”</p>
<p>I paused for a few moments and then confessed. “I dealt stud at the Ox in Missoula in '80 through '82. There was a push for this Texas Hold’em crap. I did it for a couple of months then dropped out after graduating from the university.”</p>
<p>Chris Nodded “Thought so. The Oxford—that’s Alan’s joint on Higgins, yeah? Place has history. Been runnin’ poker for decades, even before it went legal in ‘73.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Alan was my boss. I wouldn’t know the history. I was in grade school in ‘73.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Hold’em is a game show and soap opera at the same time. All-ins, river drama, complicated rules—it’s a TV show more than poker." He nodded to me. "After your performance, you flipped the script, played it tight and calm. That’s rare, man.”</p>
<p>“Calm? I pushed David. He’s been an ass on the ride all day. He’s criticized everything I did. He even told me I had to ride no closer than a mile behind them. He wouldn't believe I know anything about playing poker, so I took him for a ride.”</p>
<p>“Well, you knocked him alright. He was steaming hard by the time he left the table. But listen, I have more questions about David later. That ain't why I’m wanting to talk to you.”</p>
<p>“We’re on the edge of the Sturgis rush. Bikers, hundreds of them, pour through from west coast states and Canada, cuttin' through Glacier Park on the way to South Dakota. We're the first card room east of the Idaho border. We’re perfectly set as a biker rest stop before a day riding Going to the Sun in the park.  We'll make fifty percent of our yearly profit in the next four weeks. We’re gonna be packed. We can fill all ten tables every night, and I’m short on solid dealers who can keep the action clean and calm. I think you’re my man.”</p>
<p>“Chris, I don’t live here. I’m out near East Glacier. That’s 75 miles—the other side of Marias Pass. I’m not driving three hours round trip for a poker shift.”</p>
<p>“I hear ya. The motel across the lot—we own it, we can comp you the room. No late-night mountain passes, just a sixty-second walk to the tables. You’d be right here, no stress. You’d bring in way more money for us than the room would. You totally got the look we want with the long hair, long beard, and ink. I assume you've got a bike out front. Club guys’ll gravitate to a dealer that looks like ‘em. It’s all about affinity.”</p>
<p>“And the cut?”</p>
<p>“Standard base, but forget the base—it’s the tokes where the money is. The bikers are partying, they tip heavy, especially when the game’s smooth. You’ll be clearing way more than you did tonight, and you won’t have to hustle the whole table solo.”</p>
<p>“Still not a fan of the whole Texas Hold’em fashion show. I miss real stud poker.”</p>
<p>“I get it. Honestly? I’d rather deal stud too. But we’re a business—we gotta run what the players are throwin’ money at. They want the glamour, the drama. Think Vegas—people pay out the ass for the show. That said—I’ve been thinking about running a side table for stud. Old-school action for the older crowd, we don’t know if it would sell, but we’ll never know until we try.  But I need my main tables covered solid before I can try it.”</p>
<p>"So you're in charge here?"</p>
<p>"I run the card room and half owner of the whole place. I don't have to consult with anyone to offer this gig."</p>
<p>"I'll think about it. How soon do you need to know?"</p>
<p>"Yesterday. Can I get a number for you?"</p>
<p>"I don't have a phone."</p>
<p>"A place to leave a message?"</p>
<p>"Eh, Gladys, my landlady has made it very clear that she's not a message service. I'll call you when I get home tomorrow."</p>
<p>"You got your dealer license on you? Let me get a head start on verification." He led me to the bar where he copied down my license number and the rest of the information he needed. "Hey, you mind if I call Alan at the Oxford?"</p>
<p>"Sure, he's a good man. He'll give me a good recommendation."</p>
<p>“Appreciate you thinkin’ it over. You could get us outta a real tight spot. First time we got competition—Grouse Mountain Lodge opened a card room, poached some of our dealers.”</p>
<p>I laughed. “Ted, David, and I had dinner there this evening. It was really good.”</p>
<p>The crowd was really thinning now, just before the 2 a.m. mandatory closing. The last call sign had been up for quite a while. Staff were already out cleaning tables.</p>
<p>Chris looked at me as if sizing me up. "Can I ask you a question about your buddy, David?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>"Are you two lovers?"</p>
<p>My eyes slammed shut for a full second. How the holy fuck does everyone figure out that I'm queer? I reopened my eyes, "No," I said emphatically.</p>
<p>"What are you then?"</p>
<p>I stayed silent for an uncomfortable moment. "I guess I'm just another one of his hookers."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I wondered. That "all in" line of yours stung. I recognized him. He's been here before. He links up with the hookers, but he’s always got an eye on the young, wiry guys like you. Though, I’ve never seen him score with one. He pays you?"</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“What do you do for him?” He saw my eyes widen and quickly continued, “Relax. Not gonna judge, no matter what it is. See that guy with the long ponytail at the other end of the bar closing the till? That's Vince. My business partner—owns this place with me. Also my partner in bed. We suck each other’s dicks, and he fucks my ass. So whatever you got goin’ on? Trust me, I ain’t the one to side-eye it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, ...wow,” I stammered my voice suddenly shaking, “I’ve never met another…”  My eyes started to tear, “… another …”</p>
<p>“Gay man?” Chris finished for me.</p>
<p>I nodded, struggling to hold back tears.</p>
<p>"After your performance at the felt, I didn't realize you were so green." He called out down the bar, "Yo! Vince! I want you to meet the dealer I scoped out this evening."</p>
<p>Vince looked up from his work and nodded, walking down the length of the bar, deftly threading through his employees' cleaning work. I had admired this man from across the bar when we first came in several hours ago. His scar looked as if his scalp had once torn back. I couldn't look away. He was huge—arms out sizing my legs.</p>
<p>I forced myself to turn away, wiping the moisture from my eyes. I turned back around to face them.</p>
<p>Vince stepped up and Chris introduced us. "Vince, this is Karl, the dealer I told you about."</p>
<p>Vince reached out with his great hand and dominated mine with the biker hand clasp: a railroad sized monkey wrench versus my slender axe handle. My hand didn't even come close to encircling his wrist. “Howdy, Karl. Heard you put on a damn show at the felt tonight. Not many walk outta that room up a grand—‘cept maybe Sheila. Chris talk you into joinin’ us yet?"</p>
<p>"We're talking about it." I tried to hold down the quaver in my voice.</p>
<p>Chris looked to Vince, "Karl here is family." He turned back to me. "Now you've met two."</p>
<p>"Family, eh?" A wolfish grin grew beneath his dark beard and my dick unexpectedly awoke in my pants as our eyes connected. “All the more reason you oughta stick with us. Gotta get back, finish up the till. You gonna be around in forty when we lock up?”</p>
<p>"Can be. I don't really have much of a place to go."</p>
<p>"Great," he said to me, and then to Chris, "Treat him right."</p>
<p>Chris nodded and turned back to me. "So you're riding through with David and that older guy, uh..."</p>
<p>"Ted", I filled in.</p>
<p>"You work the same deal with Ted as you do with David?"</p>
<p>"No, I just met Ted today. I rode down to meet David in Heart Butte, we picked up Ted in Augusta at his place with his wife. She didn't come with us."</p>
<p>"Where you staying?"</p>
<p>"Place called the Glacier View, they didn't have a room for me, so I was gonna bunk in the double with Ted."</p>
<p>"I think we can arrange some better accommodations for you. Glacier View is where the hookers take their johns."</p>
<p>Just then, the woman that I recognized as the cashier that converted my chips, approached with a ledger book: "All balanced and ready for your signature."</p>
<p>Chris said to me, "I've got about twenty minutes of work to do here before we lock up for the night. You want a beer?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't drink," I thought of my faux beer bottle lost hours ago to an overeager busboy.</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah, I didn't see you drink anything all night," he turned to the woman, "Thank you, Judy, you can split anytime." Returning to me, he continued, "That's another reason I want you as dealer, sober and level-headed."</p>
<p>"Good night," Judy said as she headed for the back door.</p>
<p>"I got some closing duties to get to in the office, hang wherever you'd like, we'll be done in a bit."</p>
<p>I killed the next twenty minutes at a Williams Time Fantasy pinball machine near the pool tables. Vince and Chris approached me and said they were ready to go.</p>
<p>"Where are we going?" I felt some trepidation.</p>
<p>"I said we'd provide you with accommodations, that means we're taking you home with us." Chris smiled.</p>
<p>We stepped out the back and walked toward a car. I halted abruptly. "My bike's out front. Should I follow you?"</p>
<p>"Ah, shit, sorry,” Vince said. “Let’s stash your bike inside. That way we can talk in the car on the way. Didn’t get to see you clean out the table—figured I oughta get to know you.”</p>
<p>Chris opened the side door, while I fetched the bike. I hadn't realized the layout of the building. We actually rolled the bike into the card room. I flipped open my saddle bags and pulled out a change of clothes what I'd need for the night. I had spent the evening in my new riding leathers.</p>
<p>We drove for twenty minutes, Vince at the wheel. I think we drove toward Whitefish, but maybe toward Kalispell—being unfamiliar with the area, I wasn't sure in the dark. Chris related his perspective of my performance to Vince as we drove.</p>
<p>Vince, laughing, looked at me in the rear view mirror. "You busted your own buddy for callin' you 'kid'—and took out a little old lady in the process? Damn, you got balls."</p>
<p>"Sheila’s one of the sharpest regulars we got. She’s gnashin’ her dentures, waitin’ to take another run at you. One of our club brothers, Yogi, that's his mother." Chris laughed.</p>
<p>We pulled off the gravel forest road onto a one-lane two-track driveway, with a darkened log house at the end. I got out of the back seat and stood for a moment at the house. Hanging in the sky over it, the Great Bear, Ursus Major, my childhood friend. Another omen?</p>
<p>We talked for a while sitting in the front room of their home. Vince sat in a recliner while Chris and I sat next to each other on the plush couch. Chris reopened our interrupted conversation about my relationship with David. "What does David pay you to do?"</p>
<p>"We go out on rides for an afternoon or a day, and when we get back to his cabin in Heart Butte, I blow him."</p>
<p>"Does he reciprocate?"</p>
<p>"No, but he gives me a twenty-dollar bill."</p>
<p>Vince snorted, "You’re sellin’ yourself short. If that’s the kinda work you want, we can line up better clients—real money."</p>
<p>"I just want someone that’s as interested in me as I am in him. All I get from David is someone to ride with, the twenty bucks, and a shitload of criticism. The paying part was not my idea; he said it had to happen that way so I’d remember that he’s not gay. Blowing David is the only sex I've had for four years."</p>
<p>"What were you doing four years ago?"</p>
<p>"I had a boyfriend at the university in Bozeman, well sort of—he was just a horny guy that dated women. I fell in love with him. To him, I was just a hiking buddy that could get him off. He never reciprocated,” I said.</p>
<p>"All hell broke loose when my parents found out. They said that homos had no right to a home or a job. They said I could rightfully be sent to prison. They tried to commit me to Warm Springs Mental Institution. The psychiatrist offered shock treatments as an alternative.”</p>
<p>“Christ, did they do that to you?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm an adult, I didn't consent to it. They couldn't force it on me. The doctor said that homosexuality wasn't grounds for involuntary commitment like it used to be. Though he made it clear that he disagreed and really tried to sell me on the shock treatment as the solution to my problem."</p>
<p>Vince weighed in, "Montana—always playin’ catch-up, about forty years late.”</p>
<p>Chris turned put his hand on my shoulder. “You need to get this—bein’ gay’s just as normal as anything else.”</p>
<p>"My parents threw me out and cut me off because I refused the treatment. I took all my savings and enrolled in the state course for card dealing. I got my license. Dealing at the Oxford, mainly the tokes, paid me the cash I needed to finish my degree. As soon as I graduated, I left Missoula.”</p>
<p>“and you chose the fuckin' Blackfeet Rez? Why not a city—Seattle, or San Francisco?”</p>
<p>“I hate cities. I love mountains and wilderness. I thought I should just disappear. There's no place for me. I figured someday I wouldn't return from a hike, fall from a cliff, or stumble into an grizzly bear, and no one would ever know or care."</p>
<p>"The things you see on television about gay men in San Francisco, that's not me. I'm not like those men. I hate disco music." I looked to see if that got a smile from them, it didn't. "Until tonight I've never met another gay man, I never knew that gay men like you existed."</p>
<p>“Brother, plenty kinds of gay, same as plenty kinds of men. You been livin’ out on the rez off twenty-dollar blow jobs?”</p>
<p>"No, no, I took a job programming at a little software company in East Glacier. They make school records software for the  reservation schools. It didn't last, I fought with the owner, he fired me. I wrangled a temporary part-time job teaching programming at the Blackfeet Community College through this last spring.  I just found out last month that the college is getting contract teachers from some federal program next year, and so I've lost that job, too."</p>
<p>"Too bad nobody offered you a job a couple hours ago." Chris's crooked smile mocked me. "Oh, wait..."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to just spew my sob story at you. Sometimes, I can't summon my poker face."</p>
<p>Chris responded, "We've all got well-trained poker faces. We need them to stay alive. It’s a rough world.  You don't need it with us."</p>
<p>"It’s past three—we need to crash.” Vince glanced over at Chris, who gave a nod. “Karl, guest room’s yours. But you can bunk in our bed with us if you want.”</p>
<p>A half hour later, I lay naked between these two generous souls, Vince's muscled arm draped over my chest. There had been no sex; they just held me. I fell asleep feeling valued and safe for the first time in my adult life.</p>
