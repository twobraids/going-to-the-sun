            <h2 id="Browning,Montana">Browning, Montana</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The Teeples IGA Supermarket, the Blackfeet Indian Reservation's largest store, didn't live up to the word "super". The whole building could fit within some corner convenience stores I'd seen in far-off cities. I found myself there not for any great attraction other than it was open and closer than twenty-five miles. On a beautiful, warm spring day, I interrupted my motorcycle joy ride on the Two Medicine/Browning loop for a grocery run. As I rolled into Browning, the clock on the bank told me I couldn't get to my East Glacier grocery store before it closed for the day. I needed food, so, for the first time in my two years on the rez, I rolled into Teeples.</p>
<p>Exiting the store with a bag heavily laden with canned beans, I returned to my motorcycle, a dirty and well-worn Honda CX-500. I set the bag on the ground next to the bike. The Harley parked in the next space over had not been there when I pulled in: FXWG Wide Glide with a black tank, my dream bike.  Frozen for a couple of minutes in enchantment with the raked-out front end and the twin shovel-head cylinders, I remembered my groceries and returned to loading them into my saddlebags.</p>
<p>On finishing, I stood up, turned around, and was startled to find the Harley's obvious owner. He stared at me, wide-eyed, as if he saw a ghost. The odd expression had lasted only a moment, reverting quickly to haughty disinterest. He gave me an upward, acknowledging nod, sending a thrill down my spine.</p>
<p>I flashed back to my ten-year-old self, sitting in the car with my mother at the wheel. She took us around and around the Albertson's parking lot looking for a parking space away from that group of men on  motorcycles.</p>
<p>"Karl, stop looking at them."</p>
<p>I couldn't tear my eyes away; six men standing next to their machines: laughing, smiling, beards, long hair, tattoos, dark glasses. Two of those guys stood side by side, arms on each other’s shoulders. That thrilled me. I wanted to go with them. I wanted to be one of them.</p>
<p>She gave up, pulling into the only free space she could find next to the nearest bike. I immediately reached to open the door to get out, my side of the car being closest to them.</p>
<p>"Karl, no! Don't open the door, don't open the door!"</p>
<p>She grabbed my shoulder, stopping me. "Get out on this side. Stop looking at those animals!"</p>
<p>I couldn't understand why she was so upset. They were so beautiful and happy.</p>
<p>She dragged me across the bench seat, banging my shoulder on the steering wheel and then out, practically dumping me onto the pavement. She grabbed my hand and yanked me toward the grocery store, admonishing me for twisting around to catch another glimpse of those fascinating men.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Breaking from my reverie, I had to memorize this man in front of me, how he dressed, how he stood. Probably late thirties, well over six feet tall, wearing a black leather jacket overlaid with a denim vest. He had a thick, bushy mustache coupled with the shadowed stubble of a couple of weeks of no shaving.</p>
<p>He looked away, walking to his bike with his case of Rainier. Like the bike, he himself embodied my fantasies. I had no choice, I had to speak up. I could not let this opportunity pass. I needed to engage with him in some way.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I greeted him. "Howdy, that's a great bike." The words came out of me before I could decide what to say. The parking lot seemed to collapse until I stood in the bottom of funnel, self-conscious and inadequate for having dared to speak to him.</p>
<p>He looked at me for an uncomfortable moment and responded, "Yeah, it’s a sweet ride." Looking at my bike, his expression rapidly turning to distain, "certainly more of a bike than that rice burner."</p>
<p>"Someday, I'll be on a Harley.” I tried to be optimistic. “Might be a while, they're so expensive."</p>
<p>"Chase your dreams, kid."</p>
<p>His “kid” stung me. I averted my gaze to the ground, frustrated. I’m twenty-four. I've been old enough to drink for six years and living on my own for four years. I needed to justify, to prove myself. "I'm looking for interesting places to ride."</p>
<p>He looked at me and answered with a impatient sigh. "I just took Heart Butte Cutoff to East Glacier, ran 49 through the curves to St. Mary, then cut down 464 back here. Headin’ back to Heart Butte now. Just a quick beer run."</p>
<p>"My ride wasn't so long. I just rode US2 to East Glacier then to Two Medicine. I hiked the Trick Falls trail. Then I went up 49, like you did but only to Kiowa and then took 89 here. I live near Bison, up toward Marias Pass."</p>
<p>"On that little Jap toy? Shit, you need a real bike if you’re gonna run the highways."</p>
<p>"I'll ride what I got."</p>
<p>"How’d you like the curves on 49? Kept that thing on the pavement, did ya?"</p>
<p>I swelled with excitement. "49 is so cool. It was so much fun. I wanted to turn around and run it again in the other direction. I'm going to do it again tomorrow. It’s so close to home, easy to get to."</p>
<p>He laughed. "Well, at least you got the right attitude. How long you been ridin'?"</p>
<p>"I taught myself to ride this bike a couple months ago. It's not even mine; it belongs to my landlady, Gladys."</p>
<p>"Gladys? Railroad Creek Ranch?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, that’s her. I rent one of her cabins."</p>
<p>“Bet that’s Bob’s bike. You’re tellin’ me she owns it?” He barked out a laugh. “That fuckin’ poser. Guy’s a goddamn joke. Didn’t he haul his ass down to Colstrip lookin’ for work?”</p>
<p>"I don't know; she doesn't talk about him. I just know he just wasn't around anymore after last fall. A while back, I needed to get to Browning, and my car wouldn't start. She told me to take the bike. She says it's registered in her name and she can loan it to anyone she wants."</p>
<p>David squinted at me. “So you did already know how to ride?”</p>
<p>I answered, "No. My first ever ride was the twenty-five miles to Browning and back."</p>
<p>David let out a sharp derisive laugh. “Jesus, that’s a dumbass move. Lucky you didn’t smear yourself on the pavement.” He smirked. “Bet she figured you’d dump it just to piss Bob off.” He chuckled, shaking his head. “Hell, if you weren’t around, she’d probably take it out herself just to get under his skin. What is she now, pushin’ seventy?”</p>
<p>Thought about how I did dump it in the first two minutes, but I couldn't confess to that. "I don't know how old she is."</p>
<p>“Gotta get movin’,” he said, turning away. Then he paused, appeared to take a deep breath and turned back. “I ride every Saturday. Sometimes with some guys, mostly solo. There’s a gravel lot by the Amtrak station in East Glacier—US2 side. You show up there next Saturday, 10 sharp, and you can tag along. We’ll run 49, maybe hit some other good curves.” He looked hard at me. “What’s your name, kid?”</p>
<p>"Karl," I said, recoiling at that “kid” again, but not missing his reaction to my name. He looked relieved as if he had expected a different name. I shook that off in favor of the excitement of his offer. “Yes, I know where that is. I’ll meet you.”</p>
<p>“I'm David.” He jerked his chin at me. “Saturday. 10 o’clock. Don’t be late—I ain’t sittin’ around waitin’ on ya.”</p>
<p>I wanted to let out a whoop of triumph, but I held my excitement, invoking my poker face. I didn’t want him thinking me overeager.</p>
<p>He started his bike, rolled it out backwards, glided out to the road, and roared off southbound. Self-conscious even though he was gone, I started my bike, disappointed by its rumbly purr. I pushed back, exiting the parking lot onto the highway, turning the opposite direction onto US2. I rolled the throttle, accelerating toward my isolated cabin thirty-five miles west.</p>
