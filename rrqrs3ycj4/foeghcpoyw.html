            <h2 id="Browning,Montana">Browning, Montana</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The Teeples IGA Supermarket, the Blackfeet Reservation's largest store, didn't live up to the word "super". The whole building could fit inside a Circle K convenience store in Great Falls. The aisles were tight and crowded. No shopping carts.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I interrupted my day's motorcycle ride because I screwed up the timing. No way to get back to my regular store in East Glacier before it closed for the day.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Canned beans, canned tomatoes, and canned tuna dominated my basket. The carrots were soft, the bread was out of date, but, no options, I bought them anyway. I passed on the bacon, cost too much. Needed to economize. No work, no income. A tradeoff between gas and food.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The checker double bagged my cans to keep them from tearing through. The late afternoon sun blinded me as I pushed through the door and beelined to my bike, anxious to start the ride home.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The Harley parked in the next space had not been there when I pulled in: FXWG Wide Glide with a black tank and fenders. I froze up. Stood there like an idiot staring at it. That raked-out fork. Arrow straight pipes stretching all the way back to the hub of the rear wheel. So beautiful.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I set my grocery bag on the ground, opened the saddle bag and stacked the cans. I cinched the flap trying not to crush the bread on top.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #b77900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stood up, key in hand to start the bike when the Harley's owner pushed out of the store.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #b77900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The guy stood between me and the doorway: dark glasses stowed on top of his head, big black boots, jeans, and a black leather vest over a white T-shirt. His eyebrows had raised high, wrinkling his forehead. His jaw hung lax, showing a line of lower teeth with a gap.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned around to see what he was looking at.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Nothing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When I turned back, he was halfway to his own bike. No particular expression.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>In the body of my ten-year-old self, sitting in the car with my mother at the wheel. She took us around and around the Albertsons parking lot looking for a parking space away from that group of men on motorcycles.</p>
<p>"Karl, stop looking at them."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I couldn't tear my eyes away. Six men standing next to their machines: laughter, smiles, beards, long hair, tattoos, dark glasses. Two of those guys stood side by side, arms on each other’s shoulders. That thrilled me. I wanted to go with them. I wanted to be one of them.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She gave up, pulling into the only free space she could find next to the nearest bike. I immediately reached to open the door to get out, my side of the car closest to them.</p>
<p>"Karl, no! Don't open the door, don't open the door!"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She grabbed my shoulder, stopping my motion. "Get out on this side. Stop looking at those animals!"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>They were so beautiful and happy. Why was she so scared?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She dragged me across the bench seat, banging my shoulder on the steering wheel and then dumped me onto the pavement. Her yank off the ground hurt my shoulder. All the way into the grocery store, I got only admonishments for trying to twist around to catch a last glimpse.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Teeples, not Albertsons.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The biker repeated the same steps I took with his box of Rainier. The case wouldn't fit, so he unloaded the cans and packed them one by one into his saddlebag. He discarded cardboard remains by tossing them onto the storefront walkway.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>What's his voice sound like? Memorize him. Every detail.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Howdy. Gosh, that's a great bike." Gosh. Holy hell. Crawl under the asphalt.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He looked at me, one eyebrow lowering, but didn't say anything for a moment. "Yeah, it’s a sweet ride." One side of his mustache hitched up, showing that tooth gap again. "More of a ride than that rice burner."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I had to fix this. "I'm gonna have a Harley, someday." Not true. Never will have that.</p>
<p>"Chase your dreams, kid."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Stung. My gaze dropped to the ground. Twenty-four. Old enough to vote and drink for six years. On my own for four. Not a kid.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The card room at the Ox. Needed the poker face. Now.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Forced my head up. "I'm looking for good roads to ride. You got any suggestions?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He exhaled like he'd just taken the first drag off a cigarette. "Jesus, they're all good." He swept his arm covering the whole front range. "Indian School Road. 89, Kiowa to St Mary. Lots of good ones."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I was up at Two Medicine Lake today. I hiked the Trick Falls trail. I took 49, Kiowa and then 89 back here. Don't know Indian School. I live near Bison, up Marias Pass."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"49? On that little Jap toy? Shit, you need a real bike if you’re gonna run the highways."</p>
<p>"I'll ride what I got."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"How’d you like the curves on 49? Kept it on the pavement?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I swelled with excitement. "49 is so cool. It was so much fun." I let out a quick laugh, then regretted it. "I wanted to turn around and run it again in the other direction. I'm going to do it again tomorrow. So easy to get to."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He chuckled and his hard look melted a tiny bit. "Well, least you got the right attitude. Been ridin' long?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Taught myself to ride a couple months ago. It's not my bike. Belongs to my landlady, Gladys."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>His head tilted just the slightest bit. "Gladys? Railroad Creek Ranch?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I startled, amazed he knew her. "Yeah, that’s her. I rent one of her cabins."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“That’s Bob’s bike. You’re tellin’ me she owns it?” He lit up and laughed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Holy hell, he was so beautiful laughing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“That poser. He's such a fuckin' joke." He looked back at me, now engaged. "Didn’t he haul his ass down to Colstrip lookin' for work?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I think so. She doesn't talk about him. Not seen him since last Summer." Such a relief having all that target practice gunfire silenced.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He squinted at me. “Who taught you to ride?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Nobody. My first ride was the ranch to here and back. Well, the college, not Teeples.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The guy barked out a sharp derisive laugh. “Jesus, dumbass move. ” He smirked. “Bet she figured you’d dump it just to piss Bob off.” He chuckled, shaking his head. “Hell, if you weren’t around, she’d probably take it out herself just to get under his skin. What is she now, pushin’ seventy?”</p>
<p>Thought about how I did dump it in the first two minutes, but I couldn't confess to that. "I don't know how old she is."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Gotta get movin’.” He turned his back to me revealing a Harley screaming eagle on his vest. He froze for a moment. His shoulders dropped. Took a deep breath, then turned back around to face me. “I ride every Saturday. Sometimes with some guys, mostly on my own."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0050" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He looked to the ground, back at the store, out to the highway, finally back at my bike. "Gravel lot by the Amtrak station in East Glacier. US2 side. Show up Saturday, 10 sharp. You can tag along. I'll run 49, maybe hit some other curves.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0051" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He squinted and locked eyes on me. “What’s your name, kid?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0052" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Kid again. Couldn't swallow that heat. My failed poker face flushed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Karl. Yeah, I know where that is." I nodded. "I’ll meet you."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0054" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“I'm David.” He jerked his chin at me. “Saturday. 10 o’clock. Don’t be late. I ain’t sittin’ around waitin’ on ya.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stood down a whoop of triumph. Struggled to hold the stone face. Can't show overeagerness.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0056" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He started his bike, rolled it out backwards, glided out to the road, and roared off southbound.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0057" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Self-conscious even though he was gone, I started my bike, disappointed by its rumbly purr. I rolled back, exiting the parking lot onto the highway, avoided the gaping pothole. He turned right. I turned left.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #9d6900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I accelerated toward the wall of mountains twenty-five miles west. Chase your dreams, kid.</p>
