            <p>———> CUT 147 Story outline</p>
<p>- 5 members of the Ghost River Clan arrive the Iron Horse</p>
<p>- Seems peaceful, as if they're just riding through</p>
<p>- Dolph raises the alert level</p>
<p>- Grizz gets talking with the GRC guys and receives a gift. A couple joints laced with Angel Dust</p>
<p>- Karl walks into the bar on his break.</p>
<p>- Dolph, watching the GRC guys, sees Grizz point out Karl to them.</p>
<p>- Grizz shares the joints with Gauge, and gives one to Karl - Karl doesn't trust Griz and does not smoke it, just pockets it.</p>
<p>- The GRC guys just bide their time in the bar.</p>
<p>- A couple GRC guys start playing poker (dunno yet if it's Karl's table)</p>
<p>- Gauge and another prospect have Angel Dust freakout</p>
<p>- GRC guys rush the card room.</p>
<p>- Riot ensues. Customers scatter.</p>
<p>- Dolph grabs Karl off his poker table and swiftly moves him out the side door and then back around to the Club Room. Dolph orders Karl to stay in the Club Room.</p>
<p>- Karl waits there for an hour, vaguely hearing shouting.</p>
<p>- Karl hears a lot of bikes leaving the bar.</p>
<p>- Vince eventually enters the club room, briefly explains to Karl that the GRC targeted him. Likely due to the Reno cheating misunderstanding. Vince escorts Karl out of the clubroom and into the bar.</p>
<p>- Rooster, Bull and Lugnut have beaten the crap out of Grizz. He's missing his front teeth and is very bloody, on the floor. His pledge patch is no longer on him.</p>
<p>- Dolph and Vince escort Karl to his room across the lot and instruct him to go ride to east side of the mountains for two weeks.</p>
<p>- Dolph rides with Karl until Hungry Horse, then peels off to watch for anyone tailing them.</p>
<p>Karl rides home to his cabin on the Rez feeling exiled and frighten for his safety. He gets to his cabin at 2am.</p>

<p>A couple hours into my dealing shift at the restricted table, Snake approached. I had just raked the pot to the winner after the showdown when I finally turned to look at him.</p>
<p>In one fluid move, he raised two fingers of his left hand to mustache as if casually brushing it, then a thumb toward the bar, while he raised his right hand palm up.</p>
<p>An alert for trouble on the bar side, no need start imposing betting limits. So it was not cops or the state.</p>
<p>I just kept dealing.</p>
<p>About a poker hand later, three of Dolph's guys appeared in the card room. Goose and Yogi took up positions at the side door. Lugnut at the card room to bar corridor.</p>
