            <p>A couple hours into my dealing shift at the no limits table, Snake approached. I had just raked the pot to the winner after the showdown when I finally turned to look at him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>In one fluid move, he raised two fingers of his right hand to mustache as if bumming a cigarette while his other a thumb gestured toward the bar and he raised his left hand palm up, club sign language.</p>
<p>An alert for trouble on the bar side, no need to start imposing betting limits. No cops.</p>
<p>I just kept dealing.</p>
<p>About the time span of a poker hand later, three of Dolph's guys appeared in the card room. Lugnut and Yogi took up positions at the side door. Goose stood at the card room corridor.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Another twenty minutes passed before my relief dealer finally showed up. I needed the break, restroom first.</p>
<p>Dolph's guys stood by the office, the corridor to the club room, and the passage to the card room. Dolph himself stood at the bar obviously watching a point across the room. As I walked to the men's room, I spotted his focus, just some guys wearing patches around a table by the pool tables.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When I returned to the bar, I had a more direct view. Grizz sat at that same table. I couldn't read the patches, they weren't Bastards, I guessed Foresters. I continued over to the bar for my nightly ginger cayenne shot.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>While waiting for Whiskey, I glanced back at the table just as Grizz pointed at me. The five guys at his table all turned to look. Guys from Ghost River Clan—Jesus Christ—what were they doing all the way up here? They were the cause of the alert.</p>
<p>I turned back to the bar feigning disinterest. Snake's signal didn't mean emergency.</p>
<p>Whiskey handed over my drink, but didn't wait for my reaction—old hat now. Gauge stood at the end of the bar with Pondo. I strolled down to that end of the bar, nodding at them.</p>
<p>Pondo nodded back. "Help me talk sense into this prospect."</p>
<p>"What's he onto now?" I grinned at Gauge. "I don't think I've been able to convince him of anything yet."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"He's all horny for an EVO. Those bikes are aluminum crap, like the Jap bikes." Pondo shook his head at Gauge.</p>
<p>"Good for you." I nodded approval at Gauge. "It's the right choice. The future." I downed my shot, reveling in the cayenne burn.</p>
<p>"Goddamn, not you too? Aluminum cylinders!" Disgust on his face.</p>
<p>"I listened to Rooster and Dolph argue about it all the way from Reno." I pursed my lips. "No contest, I'm with Dolph.”</p>
<p>“How you gonna bore ‘em when it’s time?”</p>
<p>“What options you got?” I chuckled. “Massey Ferguson got some secret bike project we haven’t heard of?”</p>
<p>Grizz stepped into our conversation looking oddly nervous. He stood there in silence for a moment, then said, "I got too many of these." He dropped three joints out on the bar.</p>
<p>Gauge beamed. "Hey, good score. I go on break in ten minutes. Meet out back for a toke?"</p>
<p>"Can't, I'm gotta relieve Yogi in the card room." Grizz kept looking away from us.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I can't either, I'm on break, head back to the cardroom in just a few minutes." I shook my head.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Here, one for each of ya.”</p>
<p>Pondo and Gauge both took a joint. I hesitated but put one in the pocket of my cut.</p>
<p>Grizz left and I followed him into the card room. I took control from my relief dealer and broke open a new deck.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A couple of my players left, their replacements wore Ghost River patches. One named Rockjaw and, the other, Drift. I welcomed them, took their cash for chips, and started a game.</p>
<p>It went on for a few hands with nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After dealing fifth street, the Ghosts started comparing their hole cards. "Wut you got, Rock?"</p>
<p>"Pair'a tens."</p>
<p>"I ain't got shit."</p>
<p>By protocol, I placed my left hand over the deck, and flipped the bird over my head.</p>
<p>Snake was there in an instant. Everyone watched these guys.</p>
<p>"Is there a problem, gentlemen?"</p>
<p>Rockjaw shot back, raising his voice, "Yeah, you got a fucking faggot dealing cards."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>An adrenaline rush exploded in my chest. Lonna dealing at her table, broke protocol, turned to look. Fear.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A man shouted at the top of his lungs from out on the patio, "What did you..." and his voice dissolved into just noises.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Every head snapped around to look. Chairs scraped on the concrete floor. Players stood. Dealers locked up, hands frozen mid deal.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I fought to keep my eyes on the felt and my players. The Ghost River guys had not turned to look.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Sounded like Gauge staggering in from the patio shouting furious nonsense, "Gairt dis ging goff muh."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Screams. A poker table crashed to the floor to my right and toward the patio.</p>
<p>Rooster called out, “That's fucking angel dust!”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked up. Gauge got up from the floor, bleeding from the head, tearing his shirt off. Players exploded in all directions, some trying to protect or gather their chips, others surged toward the open patio. Pondo at the patio’s threshold, mouth agape and eyes blown wide, turned and ran toward the tracks. He tripped on the near rail and fell hard. A locomotive horn blared from a distance.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rockjaw lunged over the table, a long knife aimed at my face. "You're paying for Eldorado!" Drift flew across the table toward Snake.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I dropped to the floor and rolled, the table served as shield. From the floor, through the table legs, I saw Drift slam to the ground on top of Snake. A knife skittered across the floor.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rooster tackled Rockjaw with the whump of bodies slamming on concrete. The sound of multiple fist blows landing hard. Dolph yanked me off the floor. Dragged me toward the side door as I struggled to my feet. The train held its discordant tri-tone—an emergency wail over the shouts and noise of panicked patrons.</p>
<p>Grizz stood at his post by the door just staring at the floor. Not moving.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph cuffed Grizz on the side of his head as he pulled me through the doorway. “Do your job!”</p>
<p>Outside in the bright light, my shoulder popped painfully as Dolph tugged hard on my arm. A flash flood of customers fleeing the patio surged around the side of the building.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Four rumbling Burlington-Northern locomotives barreled into view from the west, crossing the span of the Iron Horse in an instant. Shrieking metal on metal brakes in a futile emergency stop. Box car after box car pushed each over across the scene, the locomotives far ahead still hanging on that horn.</p>
<p>"Pondo fell onto the tracks!"</p>
<p>Dolph pulled me upstream through the crowd. "No time. Nothing you can do." He threaded me through the patio strewn with overturned chairs and tables, then around to the back door of the clubroom.</p>
<p>I took a last glance back to the tracks as the train, with a final shriek and a bang, lurched to a complete stop. Couldn't see onto the rails.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As we entered the clubroom, Dolph shouted, "All hands!" The highest of the emergency levels: total building lock down, prepare to defend with firearms.</p>
<p>Five of my brothers bolted up from their seats. "Slim! Weapons locker. Now!"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>They crowded around the locker arming themselves. Checking their weapons, they filed out the front door into the corridor between the bar and the cardroom.</p>
<p>Dolph put his hand on my shoulder. "Not your fight. You’re on club room vigil. Where’s your gun?”</p>
<p>I hesitated thinking. “Left saddle bag on my bike.”</p>
<p>Dolph nodded and pulled a gun case from the locker and handed it to me. “You know what to do.”</p>
<p>He pulled a shotgun out of the locker for himself, secured the panel and then strode out the door.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0060" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The silence after that door closed crushed me. My ears rang with the screaming chaos, but the clubroom's thick brick walls muffled it all. I pressed my hand on the wall between me and the cardroom. No way of knowing what was happening just feet away.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0061" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I spent the first hour pacing, listening for sounds, any sounds, from outside. No windows. Just isolation.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0062" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You're paying for Eldorado." Rockjaw's words circled my head like vultures over a corpse.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0063" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Standing near the rear door out to the patio and the tracks, I detected the remote rumble of a train. I took it as good news. If someone had been hit, the track would have been shut down for hours. I wondered if the BN cops were out there.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0064" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>By the second hour, the path of my pacing had became an obvious trail in the carpet.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0065" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>So fucking useless—the lone pacifist among the warriors walking a gun uselessly in circles around the empty room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0066" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The space the brothers call the den offered couches and recliners, cigars, and drinks. I gave up the pacing and set gun down on the table with all the magazines.</p>
<p>I sat on the couch paging through an old copy of Easyriders not really paying attention to the busty part of the content—wishing some of the guys in these photo spreads had their shirts off.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0068" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I imagined standing behind Lonna lounging on a bike with me standing behind, arms crossed looking fierce, flashes of a camera, while a director barked instructions for poses and expressions.</p>
<p>Where was Lonna now? She'd been dealing at the next table when everything went to shit.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0070" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The clubroom door popped open with a hard shove from Dolph. He scanned the clubroom until he spotted me. Arm up, he gestured me to him. "Carnie wants you. Card room. Now."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0071" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I got up, dropping the unread magazine to the floor. "What's happened? What happened to Gauge?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0072" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Gauge's in the apartment. Stitch's talkin' him down. Gauge and Pondo got dosed. Angel Dust. Can't find Pondo."</p>
<p>Slim walked in behind Dolph and met me half way across the room. "I'm takin' room vigil off ya." He hesitated, looked me over. "Where'd you put the gun?"</p>
<p>I pointed at the den table.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0075" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Slim nodded, frowning at me. "I'll git it secured." He paused as I headed toward Dolph, but then spoke up again irritated, "Now you listen up. Next time yer on vigil, you wear it. Ya don't leave a gun settin' on a damn table."</p>
<p>I nodded my apology to him with my eyes on the floor, turned and followed Dolph out to the corridor.</p>
<p>As we approached the card room door, Carnie's furious voice boomed out. "You're a fuckin' traitor!" A percussive meaty thump followed by approving grunts and murmurs from several men.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0078" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>About eight guys stood around Bull, Griz and Carnie. Snake, with a bloody bandage wrapped around his left harm, watched Dolph escort me into the room. His eyes seemed dead. With the big overhead door to the patio closed, the room had become a dark chamber, closed to the world, private, inescapable.</p>
<p>Bull held Grizz's arms behind his back in a hold that could dislocate shoulders if pushed further. Grizz's face was a mess; his lips, nose, and scalp bled in streams.</p>
<p>His pledge cut lay on the floor in front of him, a mat to soak up his blood.</p>
<p>Carnie laid another blow with what appeared to be a night stick to the side Griz's skull. His eyes rolled white, then his head lolled forward, senseless.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0082" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Carnie glanced in my direction. I'd never seen such eyes—just as senseless as Grizz, nothing but raging fire behind them.</p>
<p>"Two Braids! Here! Now!" He pointed to the floor with the night stick  just in front of Grizz.</p>
<p>Dolph gave me a shove toward them, making me stumble. Everything seemed to get really bright.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0085" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As I stepped up to them, Carnie pressed the night stick into my hands. "This piece of shit betrayed you. Fingered you to the Ghosts. Made you target. He betrayed the club ."</p>
<p>I just stood there with wide eyes.</p>
<p>"Go on!" Carnie glared at me. "Break his fucking jaw!"</p>
<p>I held my ground.</p>
<p>Carnie's ham hand cuffed me on the shoulder. "Acid! Do it!"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0090" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stood there shaking. I lifted the night stick, but turned at the last moment and gave Carnie a firm thwack against his chest. I looked into his mad eyes, bracing for the return blow. "Is this what Brother means to you?"</p>
<p>Heavy hands grabbed both my shoulders, and swung me around to my left, away from Carnie.</p>
<p>His shriek of rage felt like the blow that he failed to land. "Acid! You little fuck! Get back here."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0093" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rooster stepped between us, arms up, palms facing Carnie.</p>
<p>Dolph frogmarched me out of the card room and down the corridor to and into the bar.  The place had been cleared. No customers. No non-club staff. No women.</p>
<p>He let go. "Follow me."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0096" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Where's Lonna? Is she okay?" He didn't answer.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0097" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I am so fucked."</p>
<p>He headed through the front door and toward my room across the lot.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0099" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We stopped by my bike. "Listen. You’re in danger. Ghosts got you marked. I’ve got guys after ’em. There’s more of ‘em around. You need to split. Now."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0100" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He scanned around the lot as if looking for movement. "Suit up. On the bike in five. I’ll sweep behind you to Hungry Horse. Make sure you're not gettin' tailed. Head back to your cabin. Hike to your lakes. Lay low a coupla weeks. Come back here, Friday, two weeks out."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0101" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"We got church next week. My first one. The July 4th party. Not enough dealers, who'd cover for me?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0102" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Not your problem. You do as I say." Dolph sounded grim.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0103" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stood in the dark stunned. "Just defied Carnie's order. I'm fucked. Why are you helping me?"</p>
<p>"Followin' his orders. Just as he said. I protect you. Even from him."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0105" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He stepped right up to me and yanked me into a hug. "You'll be ok. He'll get over it. Always does. Not throwing you out." He started walking away, but paused, turned back. "Next time you see Carnie. Give him hell. Callin' you Acid again." He shook his head.</p>
<p>"Where's Lonna?" I shouted.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0107" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Club only lockdown. All staff out. Nobody hurt." He turned and walked back toward the Iron Horse.</p>
<p>I unlocked my door and ducked in. The clock read 1:21am. I looked around for a moment feeling disoriented by the deep silence.  I kicked off my boots, dropped my jeans and donned my leather pants. I put on a long sleeve shirt, then my jacket. I braided my hair, twisted a hair tie at the end.</p>
<p>Just a minute later, I sat on my bike and fired it up, letting it idle to warm up.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0110" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Another east bound freight train roared by the backside of the Iron Horse, barreling toward the trestle and Bad Rock Canyon.</p>
<p>Another minute later, a headlight swung out from behind the far side of the bar and headed toward me.  I kicked the bike into gear.</p>
<p>We met at the edge of the lot. He head gestured me to take point. I pulled out and headed east on US2.</p>
<p>Bad Rock Canyon looked ominous and foreboding in the hard direct light of my headlight—all sharp shadows concealing threats.</p>
<p>The bike and I came back upright from the lean of the last curve of the canyon. Dolph dropped back in my mirror as we approached bridge over the Flathead River.  He turned right into the fishing access just short of the west end of the bridge. I lost sight of him as I slowed onto the empty main street of Hungry Horse.</p>
<p>Now the slow down, speed up ritual of the highway through the three towns. I wanted to fly, but didn't want to add cops to the complications of the night.</p>
<p>I rode on, obeying the speed limit in the dark of the night.</p>
<p>I caught the three headlights in my rear view mirror about halfway through the straight stretch after Corum—three bikes. I accelerated, thinking about how I could lose them. Didn’t trust who they were.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0118" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Right after the curve to West Glacier junction, I made an instant decision, took the hard left through the railroad underpass. Turned hard again and rode the bumpy Burlington Northern access road up to the tracks. From that vantage point above the highway, I would see them pass, but they wouldn't see me. I killed the bike and the lights.</p>
<p>It didn't take long. They slowed at the junction, but then accelerated east bound on the highway. I couldn't see their plates or their cuts to identify them.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0120" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>They've got about seven miles of curves where they wouldn't expect to see me ahead. Crossing Moccasin Creek, though, US2 straightens out, they'll know I turned off.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0121" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Ten minutes out, ten minutes back, twenty minutes for them to backtrack. I could use that lead time.</p>
<p>Just seconds later, that eastbound freight rounded the curve approaching the West Glacier Amtrak station. The headlight betrayed me to anyone on the highway or on MacDonald creek road. The locomotive, seeing an unexpected motorcycle next to the tracks began blasting its horn. A set of auxiliary lights switched on, highlighting me in the dark like a spotlight on stage.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0123" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Goddamn, if the train had been a minute earlier I'd have been in full view of the Ghosts.</p>
<p>All I could do was wave as it roared past. I took the opportunity to restart my bike, and ride back down to the road, our respective rumbles joining in chorus, but hiding me.</p>
<p>I had no choice now, I couldn't ride on east on US2. Didn't want meet them while they backtracked. I committed to riding by Lake McDonald  up to The Loop and up Going To the Sun to Logan pass in the dark.</p>
<p>Two minutes later, I rode round the barrier at the Glacier National Park fee station and on up the valley.</p>
<p>The pullout at the Loop, forty minutes up the road, afforded me the opportunity to listen for bikes following me. There was a distant rumble, but I attributed that to another freight down the valley.</p>
<p>Riding discretely up Going to the Sun wasn't going to happen. Not only was my bike loud, my headlight and brake light could probably be seen for miles traversing the cliff up the Garden Wall. I feathered the Hi/Lo beam switch to center position, killing the headlight entirely.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0129" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My Swiss Army knife made quick work of my brake light and running light cables. I sliced the insulation off, then I fatigued the metal by bending it back and forth until the copper parted. I tied a knot on one side to make them shorter so vibration couldn't spark them together and betray me.</p>
<p>I restarted the bike and started the ascent of the pass. Slow going, the bike in second gear, low revs seemed quieter. Without my headlight, I obsessed about the low rock wall at the edge of the road. It could never stop me from pitching over the cliff, even if I hit it at low speed.</p>
<p>After a mile and a half, I pulled into first scenic pull out with a view down the valley. I shut the bike down to listen. The rumble down the valley persisted, but shifted in origin—wrong direction for a train. There were bikes coming up the valley behind me.</p>
<p>The minutes crawled by as I concentrated on staying on the road in the dark, depending on muscle memory and dead reckoning as my only guide.</p>
<p>A herd of a big horn sheep stopped me cold. One ram actually stood his ground and lowered his head in challenge at me. A headlight flash startled him enough to run to him and his herd up the slope.</p>
<p>I scanned the valley behind me. Headlights, three single bright eyes spread out in that first long straight stretch just after the loop. The lead bike winked out as his path turned into a draw away from me.</p>
<p>Red and blue lights flashed through the trees way down in the valley below—cops coming. Figured that meant more coming up from St Mary on the other side of the pass—gotta get myself hidden.</p>
<p>Clicked my headlight on and rolled the throttle, it didn't matter now, I needed speed. No place to hide here on the West side. I passed the Weeping Wall and knew Obelene Bend and the crest of Logan Pass were near. I rode hard until I could slip into the parking lot of the visitor center.</p>
<p>My hiding place sat on the far side of the parking lot. A snow plow always sat on the utility road opposite the building.</p>
<p>I had to jump up the curb, aiming to get the bulk of the plow between my bike and the highway.  With the bike shut down, I walked downslope then sat low to the ground watching the road. From my vantage point, I could look down the St Mary Valley: flashing cop lights about a half mile below Big Drift.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0139" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The scent, the rank sour smell—there was a goddamn grizzly near. I sat bolt upright, peering into the dark. The wind came from the west, the bear probably near the visitor center. I was downwind, the bear wouldn't know about me.</p>
<p>“I’m here bear! You need know where I am! Don’t want to surprise you.”</p>
<p>The cop lights started appearing in flashes on the mountain side closer and closer as they drove through the snow corridor of Big Drift. Then into the clear, the red and blue strobes—blinding, wrecking my night vision. Two cars.</p>
<p>The second one lit a spot light that swept the Visitor Center parking lot. Stark shadows swung behind my snow plow. The light caught the bear on the sidewalk in front of the Visitor Center just as it turned and ran. Brake lights flashed bright as the cop car slowed abruptly. The spotlight swung wildly as the driver tried to track the bear.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0143" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It ran straight toward me—that absurd rocking horse gallop so typical of bears. The fucker saw the snow plow as refuge just like I did.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0144" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The light caught the bear again just as it bolted within feet of me. I was in the spotlight, but close to the ground. The bear vanished downslope under the spot light's horizon.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0145" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The spotlight swung back toward the Visitor Center and went out. The cop accelerated around the curve onto the long descent of the Garden Wall.</p>
<p>He hadn't seen me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0147" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Sprinted for my bike, restarted it, kicked it into first, rode around the plow and bumped it off the curb out to the road.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0148" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned east toward Big Drift, diminished walls of snow still on either side of the road. With the headlight on, I raged for a half hour down to St Mary—dancing to the rhythm of the asphalt, each curve now a familiar old friend.  I streaked by the East side entrance station and out of the park onto US89.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0149" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I aimed south toward  Looking Glass hill, the curves of my MT49, East Glacier and then home.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0150" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It took another full hour to get to my cabin. The clock read 4:23 when finally got inside. Exhausted, I climbed into the loft.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0151" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My cut, jacket and riding pants got dumped on the floor.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0152" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The tomblike silence of my cabin felt different than on vigil in the Club Room. I knew this silence, a welcome partner. Nobody could find me hiding under it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0153" style="color: #573e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The first light of dawn and the chorus of birds an hour later found me still staring straight up at the apex of the A-frame above my bed. I eventually got up, knowing sleep wasn't going to happen.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0154" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Figured it'd be a good day to keep my head down, maybe straighten up the place a bit.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0155" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The loose joint I found on the floor went into the ziplock bag on my desk with all the others.</p>
