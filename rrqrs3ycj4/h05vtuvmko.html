<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A couple hours into my dealing shift at the restricted table, Snake approached. I had just raked the pot to the winner after the showdown when I finally turned to look at him.</p>
<p>In one fluid move, he raised two fingers of his right hand to mustache as if asking for a cigarette while his other a thumb gestured toward the bar as he raised his left hand palm up.</p>
<p>An alert for trouble on the bar side, no need start imposing betting limits. Not cops or the state.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I just kept dealing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>About a poker hand later, three of Dolph's guys appeared in the card room. Goose and Yogi took up positions at the side door. Lugnut at the card room to bar corridor.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I sat alone on the couch paging through an old copy of Easyriders not really paying attention to the content. The clubroom door popped open with Dolphs hard shove.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He scanned the clubroom until he spotted me. Arm up he gestured me to him. "Vince wants you in the card room. C'mon."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I got up, dropping the unseen magazine on the floor.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As we approached the card room door, Vince's fury voice boomed out. "You fuckin' traitor." The the sound of a blow.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>About eight stood around Bull, Griz and Vince. Bull held Grizz's arms behind his back in a hold could dislocate shoulders if push further. Grizz face was a bloody mess. His lips, his nose and his scalp bled in streams.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>His pledge cut lay on the floor in front of him, a mat to soak up his blood.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince laid another blow with what appeared to be a night stick to the side Griz's head. It tipped to the side, his eyes only showing whites, then his head lolled forward, senseless.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince glanced my direction. I'd never seen such eyes—just as senseless as Grizz, nothing but rage behind them.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Two Braids! Here now!" He pointed to the floor with the night stick  just in front of Grizz.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph gave me a shove toward them, making me stumble. Everything seemed to get really bright.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As I stepped up to them, Vince pressed the night stick into my hands. "Two Braids. This piece of shit betrayed you. Pointed you out to the Ghosts. Made you the target."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I just stood there with wide eyes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Go on! Hit him." Vince glared at me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Break his fucking jaw!"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I held my ground.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince's ham hand cuffed me on the shoulder. I swung the night stick with a firm thwack against Vince's chest. I looked into his mad eyes, bracing for the blow. "Is this what brother means to you?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Heavy hands grabbed both my shoulders, and swung me around to my left, away from Vince. His shriek of rage hurt my ears.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Two Braids! You fuck! Get back here."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I caught a glimpse of Rooster stepping in to face Vince, shouting.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph frogmarched me out of the card room and down the corridor to and into the bar.  The place had been cleared. No customers, no non club staff.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He let go. "Follow me."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He headed through the front door and headed straight for my room across the lot.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We stopped by my bike. "Listen. You’re in danger. Ghosts got you marked. I’ve got guys lookin’ for ’em. You need to split. Now."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0048" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Suit up. On the bike in five. I’ll sweep behind you to Hungry Horse. Make sure you're not gettin' tailed. Head back to your cabin. Hike to your lakes. Lay low a coupla weeks. Come back here, Friday, two weeks out."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I just defied Carnie. I'm in big trouble, why are you abetting me?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0050" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Followin' his orders. Just as he said. I protect you. Even from him."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0051" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He stepped straight up to me and embraced me. "It'll be fine. He always comes down." He turned and walked back toward the Iron Horse.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0052" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I unlocked my door and ducked in. The clock read 1:21am. I looked around for a moment feeling disoriented by the deep silence.  I kicked off my boots, dropped my jeans and donned my leather pants. I put on a long sleeve shirt, then my jacket. I braided my hair, twisted a hair tie at the end.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Just a minute later, I sat on my bike and fired it up, letting it idle to warm up.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0054" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>An east bound freight train roared by the Iron Horse, barreling toward the trestle and Bad Rock Canyon.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Another minute later, a headlight swung out from behind the other side of the bar and headed toward me.  I kicked the bike into gear.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0056" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We met at the edge of the lot. He head gestured me to take point. I pulled out and headed east on US2.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0057" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Bad Rock Canyon looked ominous and foreboding in the hard direct light of my headlight—all sharp shadows concealing threats.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The bike and I came back upright from the lean of the last curve of the canyon. Dolph dropped back in my mirror as we approached bridge over the Flathead River.  He turned right into the fishing access just short of the west end of the bridge. I lost sight of him as I slowed onto the empty main street of Hungry Horse.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0059" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Now the slow down, speed up ritual of the highway through the three towns. I wanted to fly, but didn't want to add cops to the complications of the night.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0060" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I rode on, obeying the speed limit in the dark of the night.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0061" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I caught the three headlights in my rear view mirror about halfway through the straight stretch after Corum—three bikes. I accelerated, thinking about how I could lose them. Didn’t trust who they were.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0062" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>At West Glacier junction, I made an instant decision, took the hard left through the railroad underpass. Turned hard again and rode the bumpy Burlington Northern access road up to the tracks.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0063" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>From that vantage point from above the highway, I could see them pass, but they wouldn't see me. It didn't take long. They slowed at the junction, but then accelerated east bound on the highway.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0064" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Just a second later, that eastbound freight rounded the curve approaching Belton station. The headlight, a spotlight, made me visible to anyone on the highway or on MacDonald creek road. The locomotive, seeing an unexpected motorcycle near the tracks began blasting its horn.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0065" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>All I could do is wave as it rumbled by. I took the opportunity to restart my bike, and ride back down to the road, our respective rumbles joining in chorus, but hiding me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0066" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I had no choice now, I couldn't ride on east on US2. Didn't want to ride behind them. I committed to riding MacDonald Creek road up to The Loop and on up Going To the Sun to Logan pass in the dark.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0067" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Two minutes later, I rode round the barrier at the Glacier National Park fee station and on up the valley.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0068" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stopped at The Loop to listen for bikes following me. There was a distant rumble, but I attributed that to another far off freight. Riding discretely up Logan Pass wasn't going to happen. Not only was my bike loud, my headlight and brake light could be seen for miles traversing the cliff the the Garden Wall. My headlamp had an off switch. The brake light did not.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0069" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I got off the bike and pulled out my Swiss Army knife. I sliced the insulation off my brake light wire. Then I fatigued the metal by bending it back and forth until the copper parted. I tied a knot in one wire to make it shorter so that it could not make contact with the other wire and betray me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0070" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I restarted the bike and started the ascent of the pass. Slow going, the bike in second gear, low revs seemed quieter.  I kept thinking of that low rock wall in the dark that could never stop me from pitching over the cliff, even if I hit it at low speed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0071" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I rode into the first scenic pull out with a view down the valley. I shut the bike down to listen. The rumble down the valley persisted, but shifted in origin—wrong direction for a train. There were bike ascending behind me.</p>
<p>The next forty-five minutes crawled by, depending on muscle memory and dead reckoning as my guide up Going to the Sun. A herd of a big horn sheep stopped me cold. One ram actually stood his ground and lowered his head in challenge at me. A headlight flash startled him enough to run to his herd up the slope.</p>
<p>I scanned the valley behind me. Headlights edged around the curves, three of them spread out in that first long straight stretch just after the loop. The lead bike winked out as his path turned away from me.</p>
<p>Red and blue lights flashed through the trees way down in the valley below—cops coming. Figured that meant more coming up from St Mary on the other side of the pass. Gotta get myself hidden.</p>
<p>Clicked my headlight on and rolled the throttle. No place to hide here on the West side. I passed the Weeping Wall and knew Obelene Bend and the crest of Logan’s Pass were near. Acceeratud until I could slip into the parking lot of the visitor center.</p>
<p>My hiding place sat on the far side of the parking lot. A snow plow always sat on the utility road opposite the building.</p>
<p>I had to jump up the curb to get the bulk of the machine between my bike and the highway.  With the bike shut down, I sat low to the ground watching the road. From my vantage point, I could look down the St Mary Valley: flashing cop lights just below Big Drift.</p>
<p>The scent, the rank sour smell—there was a goddamn grizzly near. I sat bolt upright, peering into the dark. The came from the west, the bear was near the visitor center. Downwind: the bear probably didn’t know about me.</p>
<p>“I’m here bear! You need know where I am! Don’t want to surprise you.”</p>
<p>The cop lights started appearing in flashes on the mountain side closer and closer. Then red and blue strobes—blinding, wrecking my night vision. Two cars. The second one lit a spot light that swept the Visitor Center parking lot. Stark shadows swung behind my snow plow.</p>
<p>The light caught the bear on the sidewalk in front of the Visitor Center just as it turned and ran downslope</p>
<p>The cops flew by the parking lot around the curve onto the long descent down the other side of the pass.</p>
<p>I sprinted for my bike, restarted it, jumped it back off the curb and out to the road. With the headlight on, I raged for a half hour down to St Mary, out of the park and on south toward Looking Glass hill and my cabin.</p>
<p>The clock read 4:23 when finally got inside. Exhausted, I climbed into the loft. I slept seven hours isolated from everything.</p>
<p>Nobody could find my cabin.</p>
