            <p>A couple hours into my dealing shift at the no limits table, Snake approached. I had just raked the pot to the winner after the showdown when I finally turned to look at him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>In one fluid move, he raised two fingers of his right hand to mustache as if asking for a cigarette while his other a thumb gestured toward the bar as he raised his left hand palm up.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>An alert for trouble on the bar side, no need start imposing betting limits. Not cops or the state.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I just kept dealing.</p>
<p>About the time span of a poker hand later, three of Dolph's guys appeared in the card room. Goose and Yogi took up positions at the side door. Lugnut at the card room to bar corridor.</p>
<p>Another twenty minutes passed and my relief dealer approached my table. I needed the break, restroom first.</p>
<p>Dolph's guys stood by the office, the corridor to the club room, and the passage to the card room. Dolph himself stood at the bar obviously watching a point across the room. As I walked to the men's room, I spotted his focus, just some guys wearing patches around a table by the pool tables.</p>
<p>When I returned to the bar, I had a more direct view. Grizz sat at that same table. I couldn't read the patches, they weren't Bastards, I guessed Foresters. I continued over to the bar for my nightly ginger cayenne shot from Whiskey.</p>
<p>While waiting for Whiskey, I glanced back at the table just as Grizz pointed at me. The five guys at his table all turned to look. Guys from Ghost River Clan—Jesus Christ—what were they doing all the way up here? This was the alert.</p>
<p>I turned back to the bar feigning disinterest. Snake's signal didn't mean emergency.</p>
<p>Whiskey handed over my drink, but didn't wait for my reaction—old hat now. Gauge stood at the end of the bar with Pondo. I strolled down to that end of the bar, nodding at them.</p>
<p>Pondo nodded back. "Help me talk sense into this prospect."</p>
<p>"What's he onto now?" I grinned at Gauge. "I don't think I've been able to convince him of anything yet."</p>
<p>"He's all horny for an EVO." Pondo shook his head at Gauge.</p>
<p>"Good for you." I nodded approval at Gauge. "It's the right choice. The future."</p>
<p>"Goddamn, not you too?" Disgust on his face.</p>
<p>"I listened to Rooster and Dolph argue about it all the way from Reno." I pursed my lips. "No contest, I'm with Dolph.”</p>
<p>Grizz stepped into our conversation looking oddly nervous. He stood there in silence for a moment, then said, "I got too many of these." He dropped three joints out on the bar.</p>
<p>Gauge beamed. "Hey, good score. I go on break in ten minutes. Meet out back for a toke?"</p>
<p>"Can't, I'm gotta relieve Yogi at the backdoor in the card room." Grizz kept looking away from us.</p>
<p>"I can't either, I gotta get back to dealing." I shook my head.</p>
<p>"Here, each of you take one."</p>
<p>Pondo and Gauge both took a joint. I hesitated but put one in the pocket of my cut.</p>
<p>Grizz left and I followed him into the card room. I took control from my relief dealer and broke open a new deck.</p>
<p>A couple of my players left, my two new one's wore Ghost River patches. One named Rockjaw and, the other, Drift. I welcomed them, took their cash for chips, and started a game.</p>
<p>It went on for a few hands with nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>On fifth street the Ghosts started comparing their cards. "Wut you got, Rock?"</p>
<p>"Pair'a tens."</p>
<p>"I ain't got shit."</p>
<p>By protocol, I placed my left hand over the deck, and flipped the bird over my head.</p>
<p>Snake was there in an instant. Everyone watched these guys.</p>
<p>"Is there a problem, gentlemen?"</p>
<p>Rockjaw shot back, raising his voice, "Yeah, you got a fucking queer dealing cards here."</p>
<p>Lonna, at the next table closer to the patio, broke the eyes on the felt rule and turned to look.</p>
<p>From the patio, a man's piercing scream silenced all conversions. The players all over the card room turned to look, some knocking over their chairs as they stood up.</p>
<p>Gauge staggered into the card room from the patio shrieking, "Get them off me! Get them off me!"  He slapped at his own chest, legs and head as if his clothes burned. He pulled on the collar of his shirt until it ripped.</p>
<p>Pondo stood out on the patio looking confused and frightened, then bolted across the railroad tracks and into the field beyond.</p>
<p>Mayhem. Players started to run to the exits, some trying to protect and gather their chips, women screamed.</p>
<p>Without warning, Rockjaw leapt over our poker table with a knife aimed at me. Drift played blocker, flying between me and Snake to keep him from interfering.</p>
<p>I dropped to the floor and rolled as taught in that one Aikido lesson I attended. It worked.</p>
<p>Dolph yanked me off the floor and toward the side door. Grizz stood post by the door just staring at the floor. Not moving, taking no action.</p>
<p>A flash flood of customers fleeing the patio surged around the side of the building. Dolph pulled me upstream, across the patio strewn with overturn chairs, around through the back door into the clubroom.</p>
<p>He shouted, "Code 10!" as we entered. Five of my brothers bolted up from their seats. "Slim! Weapons locker. Now!"</p>
<p>They all armed themselves and filed out the front door to the corridor between the bar and the cardroom.</p>
<p>Dolph put his hand on my shoulder. "Not your fight. You stay here." He pulled a shotgun out of the locker and left me alone.</p>
<p>I spent the first hour just pacing listening for sounds in the cardroom next door or outside. No windows. Just isolation.</p>
<p>What the fuck happened to Gauge and Pondo?</p>
<hr>
<p>I sat on the couch paging through an old copy of Easyriders not really paying attention to the busty content—wishing some of the guys in these photo spreads had their shirts off. I imagined standing behind Lonna lounging on a bike with me standing behind, arms crossed looking fierce, flashes of a camera, while a director barked directions.</p>
<p>Where was Lonna now? She'd been dealing at the next table when everything fell apart.</p>
<p>The clubroom door popped open with a hard shove from Dolph. He scanned the clubroom until he spotted me. Arm up, he gestured me to him. "Carnie wants you. Card room. Now. C'mon."</p>
<p>I got up, dropping the unread magazine to the floor.</p>
<p>As we approached the card room door, Carnie's furious voice boomed out. "You're a fuckin' traitor." The the sound of a blow.</p>
<p>About eight guys stood around Bull, Griz and Carnie. Bull held Grizz's arms behind his back in a hold could dislocate shoulders if pushed further. Grizz's face was a bloody mess. His lips, his nose and his scalp bled in streams.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0054" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>His pledge cut lay on the floor in front of him, a mat to soak up his blood.</p>
<p>Carnie laid another blow with what appeared to be a night stick to the side Griz's skull. His eyes rolled white, then his head lolled forward, senseless.</p>
<p>Carnie glanced my direction. I'd never seen such eyes—just as senseless as Grizz, nothing but raging fire behind them.</p>
<p>"Two Braids! Get over here!" He pointed to the floor with the night stick  just in front of Grizz.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph gave me a shove toward them, making me stumble. Everything seemed to get really bright.</p>
<p>As I stepped up to them, Carnie pressed the night stick into my hands. "Two Braids. This piece of shit betrayed you. Pointed you out to the Ghosts. Made you the target."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0060" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I just stood there with wide eyes.</p>
<p>"Go on! Hit him." Carnie glared at me. "Break his fucking jaw!"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0062" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I held my ground.</p>
<p>Carnie's ham hand cuffed me on the shoulder. "Do it!"</p>
<p>I stood there shaking. I lifted the night stick, but turned at the last moment and gave Carnie a firm thwack against his chest. I looked into his mad eyes, bracing for the return blow. "Is this what brother means to you?"</p>
<p>Heavy hands grabbed both my shoulders, and swung me around to my left, away from Carnie.</p>
<p>His shriek of rage felt like the blow that he failed to land. "Two Braids! You little fuck! Get back here."</p>
<p>Rooster stepped between us, his palms up facing Carnie.</p>
<p>Dolph frogmarched me out of the card room and down the corridor to and into the bar.  The place had been cleared. No customers. No non-club staff. No women.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0069" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He let go. "Follow me."</p>
<p>"Where's Lonna. Is she okay?" My voice sounded pleading to me. I didn't get an answer.</p>
<p>He headed through the front door and toward my room across the lot.</p>
<p>We stopped by my bike. "Listen. You’re in danger. Ghosts got you marked. I’ve got guys after ’em. There’s more of ‘em. You need to split. Now."</p>
<p>He scanned around the lot as if looking for movement. "Suit up. On the bike in five. I’ll sweep behind you to Hungry Horse. Make sure you're not gettin' tailed. Head back to your cabin. Hike to your lakes. Lay low a coupla weeks. Come back here, Friday, two weeks out."</p>
<p>I stood in the dark stunned. "I just defied Carnie. I'm in such trouble, why are you helping me?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0075" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Followin' his orders. Just as he said. I protect you. Even from him."</p>
<p>He stepped right up to me and yanked me into a hug. "You'll be ok. He always comes down. Won't last." He turned and walked back toward the Iron Horse.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0077" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I unlocked my door and ducked in. The clock read 1:21am. I looked around for a moment feeling disoriented by the deep silence.  I kicked off my boots, dropped my jeans and donned my leather pants. I put on a long sleeve shirt, then my jacket. I braided my hair, twisted a hair tie at the end.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0078" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Just a minute later, I sat on my bike and fired it up, letting it idle to warm up.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0079" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>An east bound freight train roared by the Iron Horse, barreling toward the trestle and Bad Rock Canyon.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0080" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Another minute later, a headlight swung out from behind the other side of the bar and headed toward me.  I kicked the bike into gear.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0081" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We met at the edge of the lot. He head gestured me to take point. I pulled out and headed east on US2.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0082" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Bad Rock Canyon looked ominous and foreboding in the hard direct light of my headlight—all sharp shadows concealing threats.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0083" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The bike and I came back upright from the lean of the last curve of the canyon. Dolph dropped back in my mirror as we approached bridge over the Flathead River.  He turned right into the fishing access just short of the west end of the bridge. I lost sight of him as I slowed onto the empty main street of Hungry Horse.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0084" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Now the slow down, speed up ritual of the highway through the three towns. I wanted to fly, but didn't want to add cops to the complications of the night.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0085" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I rode on, obeying the speed limit in the dark of the night.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0086" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I caught the three headlights in my rear view mirror about halfway through the straight stretch after Corum—three bikes. I accelerated, thinking about how I could lose them. Didn’t trust who they were.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0087" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>At West Glacier junction, I made an instant decision, took the hard left through the railroad underpass. Turned hard again and rode the bumpy Burlington Northern access road up to the tracks.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0088" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>From that vantage point from above the highway, I could see them pass, but they wouldn't see me. It didn't take long. They slowed at the junction, but then accelerated east bound on the highway.</p>
<p>Just a second later, that eastbound freight rounded the curve approaching the West Glacier Amtrak station. The headlight, a spotlight, betrayed me to anyone on the highway or on MacDonald creek road. The locomotive, seeing an unexpected motorcycle next to the tracks began blasting its horn.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0090" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>All I could do is wave as it rumbled by. I took the opportunity to restart my bike, and ride back down to the road, our respective rumbles joining in chorus, but hiding me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0091" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I had no choice now, I couldn't ride on east on US2. Didn't want to ride behind them. I committed to riding MacDonald Creek road up to The Loop and on up Going To the Sun to Logan pass in the dark.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0092" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Two minutes later, I rode round the barrier at the Glacier National Park fee station and on up the valley.</p>
<p>The pullout at the Loop afforded me the opportunity to listen for bikes following me. There was a distant rumble, but I attributed that to another far off freight down the valley.</p>
<p>Riding discretely up Going to the Sun wasn't going to happen. Not only was my bike loud, my headlight and brake light could probably be seen for miles traversing the cliff up the Garden Wall. My headlamp had an off switch. The brake light did not.</p>
<p>My Swiss Army knife made quick work of my brakelight cable. I sliced the insulation off, then I fatigued the metal by bending it back and forth until the copper parted. I tied a knot in one wire to make it shorter so vibration couldn't spark them together and betray me.</p>
<p>I restarted the bike and started the ascent of the pass. Slow going, the bike in second gear, low revs seemed quieter. Without my headlight, I obsessed about the low rock wall at the edge of the road. It could never stop me from pitching over the cliff, even if I hit it at low speed.</p>
<p>After a mile and a half, I pulled into first scenic pull out with a view down the valley. I shut the bike down to listen. The rumble down the valley persisted, but shifted in origin—wrong direction for a train. There were bikes coming up the valley behind me.</p>
<p>The minutes crawled by as I concentrated on staying on the road in the dark, depending on muscle memory and dead reckoning as my only guide.</p>
<p>A herd of a big horn sheep stopped me cold. One ram actually stood his ground and lowered his head in challenge at me. A headlight flash startled him enough to run to him and his herd up the slope.</p>
<p>I scanned the valley behind me. Headlights, three single bright eyes spread out in that first long straight stretch just after the loop. The lead bike winked out as his path turned into a draw away from me.</p>
<p>Red and blue lights flashed through the trees way down in the valley below—cops coming. Figured that meant more coming up from St Mary on the other side of the pass—gotta get myself hidden.</p>
<p>Clicked my headlight on and rolled the throttle, it didn't matter now, I needed speed. No place to hide here on the West side. I passed the Weeping Wall and knew Obelene Bend and the crest of Logan Pass were near. I rode hard until I could slip into the parking lot of the visitor center.</p>
<p>My hiding place sat on the far side of the parking lot. A snow plow always sat on the utility road opposite the building.</p>
<p>I had to jump up the curb, aiming to get the bulk of the plow between my bike and the highway.  With the bike shut down, I walked downslope then sat low to the ground watching the road. From my vantage point, I could look down the St Mary Valley: flashing cop lights about a half mile below Big Drift.</p>
<p>The scent, the rank sour smell—there was a goddamn grizzly near. I sat bolt upright, peering into the dark. The wind came from the west, the bear was near the visitor center. Downwind: the bear probably didn’t know about me.</p>
<p>“I’m here bear! You need know where I am! Don’t want to surprise you.”</p>
<p>The cop lights started appearing in flashes on the mountain side closer and closer as they drove through the snow corridor of Big Drift. Then into the clear, the red and blue strobes—blinding, wrecking my night vision. Two cars.</p>
<p>The second one lit a spot light that swept the Visitor Center parking lot. Stark shadows swung behind my snow plow. The light caught the bear on the sidewalk in front of the Visitor Center just as it turned and ran. Brake lights flashed bright as the cop car slowed abruptly. The spotlight swung wildly as the driver tried to track the bear.</p>
<p>It ran straight toward me. It saw the snow plow as refuge just like I did.</p>
<p>The light caught the bear again just as it bolted within feet of me. I was in the spotlight, but close to the ground. The bear vanished downslope into the dark.</p>
<p>The spotlight swung back toward the Visitor Center and went out. The cop accelerated around the curve onto the long descent of the other side of the pass.</p>
<p>He hadn't seen me.</p>
<p>I sprinted for my bike, restarted it, kicked it into first, rode around the plow and jumped it back off the curb out to the road.</p>
<p>I turned toward Big Drift, diminished walls of snow still on either side of the road. With the headlight on, I raged for a half hour down to St Mary, getting as much speed as I could. I streaked by the East side entrance station and out of the park onto US89.</p>
<p>I aimed south toward Looking Glass hill, East Glacier and then home.</p>
<p>It took another full hour to get to my cabin. The clock read 4:23 when finally got inside. Exhausted, I climbed into the loft. I slept seven hours in the tomb like silence of my cabin.</p>
<p>Nobody could find me here.</p>
