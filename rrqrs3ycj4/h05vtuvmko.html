<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- 5 members of the Ghost River Clan arrive the Iron Horse</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- Seems peaceful, as if they're just riding through</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- Dolph raises the alert level</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- Grizz gets talking with the GRC guys and receives a gift. A couple joints laced with Angel Dust</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- Karl walks into the bar on his break.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- Dolph, watching the GRC guys, sees Grizz point out Karl to them.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- Grizz shares the joints with Gauge, and gives one to Karl - Karl doesn't trust Griz and does not smoke it, just pockets it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- The GRC guys just bide their time in the bar.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- A couple GRC guys start playing poker (dunno yet if it's Karl's table)</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- Gauge and another prospect have Angel Dust freakout</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- GRC guys rush the card room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- Riot ensues. Customers scatter.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- Dolph grabs Karl off his poker table and swiftly moves him out the side door and then back around to the Club Room. Dolph orders Karl to stay in the Club Room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- Karl waits there for an hour, vaguely hearing shouting.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- Karl hears a lot of bikes leaving the bar.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- Vince eventually enters the club room, briefly explains to Karl that the GRC targeted him. Likely due to the Reno cheating misunderstanding. Vince escorts Karl out of the clubroom and into the bar.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- Rooster, Bull and Lugnut have beaten the crap out of Grizz. He's missing his front teeth and is very bloody, on the floor. His pledge patch is no longer on him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- Dolph and Vince escort Karl to his room across the lot and instruct him to go ride to east side of the mountains for two weeks.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>- Dolph rides with Karl until Hungry Horse, then peels off to watch for anyone tailing them.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Karl rides home to his cabin on the Rez feeling exiled and frighten for his safety. He gets to his cabin at 2am.</p>

<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A couple hours into my dealing shift at the restricted table, Snake approached. I had just raked the pot to the winner after the showdown when I finally turned to look at him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>In one fluid move, he raised two fingers of his left hand to mustache as if casually brushing it, then a thumb toward the bar, while he raised his right hand palm up.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>An alert for trouble on the bar side, no need start imposing betting limits. So it was not cops or the state.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I just kept dealing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>About a poker hand later, three of Dolph's guys appeared in the card room. Goose and Yogi took up positions at the side door. Lugnut at the card room to bar corridor.</p>
<hr>
<p>I sat alone on the couch paging through an old copy of Easyriders not really paying attention to the content. The clubroom door popped open with Dolphs hard shove.</p>
<p>He scanned the clubroom until he spotted me. Arm up he gestured me to him. "Vince wants you in the card room. C'mon."</p>
<p>I got up, dropping the unseen magazine on the floor.</p>
<p>As we approached the card room door, Vince's fury voice boomed out. "You fuckin' traitor." The the sound of a blow.</p>
<p>About eight stood around Bull, Griz and Vince. Bull held Grizz's arms behind his back in a hold could dislocate shoulders if push further. Grizz face was a bloody mess. His lips, his nose and his scalp bled in streams.</p>
<p>His pledge cut lay on the floor in front of him, a mat to soak up his blood.</p>
<p>Vince laid another blow with what appeared to be a night stick to the side Griz's head. It tipped to the side, his eyes only showing whites, then his head lolled forward, senseless.</p>
<p>Vince glanced my direction. I'd never seen such eyes—just as senseless as Grizz, nothing but rage behind them.</p>
<p>"Two Braids! Here now!" He pointed to the floor with the night stick  just in front of Grizz.</p>
<p>Dolph gave me a shove toward them, making me stumble. Everything seemed to get really bright.</p>
<p>As I stepped up to them, Vince pressed the night stick into my hands. "Two Braids. This piece of shit betrayed you. Pointed you out to the Ghosts. Made you the target."</p>
<p>I just stood there with wide eyes.</p>
<p>"Go on! Hit him." Vince glared at me.</p>
<p>"Break his fucking jaw!"</p>
<p>I still held my ground.</p>
<p>Vince ham hand cuffed me on the shoulder. I swung night stick with a firm thwack against Vince's chest. I looked into his mad eyes, bracing for the blow. "Is this what brother means to you?"</p>
<p>Heavy hands grabbed both my shoulders, and swung me around to my left, away from Vince. His shriek of rage hurt my ears. I caught a glimpse of Rooster stepping in to face Vince, shouting.</p>
<p>Dolph frogmarched me out of the card room and down the corridor to and into the bar.  The place had been cleared. No customers, no non club staff.</p>
<p>He let go. "Follow me."</p>
<p>He headed through the front door and headed straight for my room across the lot.</p>
<p>We stopped by my bike. "Listen, you're in danger. The Ghosts have targeted you. Got guys out chasing them. You need to split."</p>
<p>"Suit up. On the bike in five minutes. I'm gonna follow you to Hungry Horse. Make sure you're not gettin' tailed. Head back to your cabin. Go hike into your lakes. Lay low for two weeks. Come back here, Friday, two weeks out."</p>
<p>He stepped straight up to me and embraced me. "It'll be ok. Vince always calms down." He turned and walked back toward the Iron Horse.</p>
<p>I unlocked my door and ducked in. I looked around for a moment feeling disoriented by the deep silence.  I kicked off my boots, dropped my jeans and donned my leather pants. I put on a long sleeve shirt, then my jacket. I braided my hair, twisted a hair tie at the end.</p>
<p>Just a minute later, I sat on my bike and fired it up, letting it idle to warm up.</p>
<p>Another minutes later, a headlight swung out from behind the other side of the bar and headed toward me.  I kicked the bike into gear.</p>
<p>We met at the edge of the lot. He head gestured me to take point. I pulled out and headed east on US2.</p>
<p>Bad Rock Canyon didn't looked ominous and foreboding in the hard direct light of my headlight—all sharp shadows concealing threats.</p>
<p>The bike and I came back upright at the last curve of the canyon. I watch Dolph drop back in my mirror as we approached bridge over the Flathead River.  He turned into the fishing access just</p>
