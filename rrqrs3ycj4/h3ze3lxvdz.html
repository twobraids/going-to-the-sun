<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We pulled into the campground just as I started to get hungry. Just a few camp spaces occupied. Chris likely chose the site more for the walking convenience to the lodge than any sense of wanting privacy.  We parked the bikes near a thick ponderosa.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris walked off to the office to rent the space. I scoped out a place for my tent, rolled it out, unfolded. The three fiberglass poles, shock corded, snapped themselves together. Sixty seconds later, my tent fully erected, I crawled in checking for level.  I had to pick it up to move a way from a bulging tree root. After testing it again, I staked the tent down.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Gone for two minutes and you've already moved in."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I hadn't seen Chris come back.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"What the fuck is that?" He gestured to my blue and white ripstop-nylon tent. "</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"It's my backpacking tent. What's wrong with it?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You packed some sort of NASA landing pod?" He examined the poles holding themselves up with tension, the roof tightly suspended beneath them.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"It's a great tent. Really light, easy to carry for miles."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Clever design. Goddamn." He pointed at the green canvas roll strapped to his sissy bar. "That ancient thing takes twenty minutes to assemble and will always collapse at least once during the night."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He refocused on my tent. "Look at the balanced tension on this.” He thrummed the arched pole as if it were a bass string. “It can't fucking fall down."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He looked at me. "You got room for two in there?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I smiled. "Always."</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When Chris and I got into the hot tub, it only took a few minutes for everyone else to leave. The women, specifically, seemed to be really uncomfortable with us—if they only knew the truth.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After we were alone in the water, I asked, "Can ask something about Vince?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Maybe."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"What was the deal between him and Acid?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Acid? Whaddaya mean?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Vince used to visit him in Deer Lodge. Everybody called him a fuck up." I huffed once. "What I really mean, uh, why does Vince keep accidentally calling me Acid?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris didn't answer for a half a minute. "Vince fell for Acid way back. Long. before I came around.   They fucked around, but men weren't really Acid's thing, except when he was drunk or tripping. First love, though. Vince'll always have a soft spot for him."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He sighed, "I'm sorry that's happenin'. Yeah, everybody sees the similarities, but hell, he's gotta let it go. You're not Acid. I'll talk to him when we get back."</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="1985-06-03-US-93South,Idaho">1985-06-03 - US-93 South, Idaho</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When we emerged from the canyon onto the broad barren Idaho valley on US93, I recognized the Big Lost River Valley. I immediately scanned the eastern face of the mountains for the fault scarp. Took me a moment to realize the whitish line at the base of the mountains wasn't a road.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I rolled the throttle, closed the distance with Chris, flipped the highbeam on to catch his attention. When I saw his brake tap acknowledgment, I raised my left arm in an arc over my head and pointed down to the left shoulder, the pull-over-signal.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Once stopped, I hopped off the bike and pulled my map from my pack. I checked back and forth between the map and the mountain wall east of the valley, Borah Peak—gotta get up there someday—highest point in Idaho.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris just stood there looking at me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I gotta do a side trip, I need to see the fault scarp."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He looked at me with resignation. “Winnamuca is a lotta hours away.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"About two miles ahead there's a dirt road that heads straight for that mountain. Only about two and half miles to it. I need to see it."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"What again do you need to see?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"The fault scarp. Just a year and a half ago, there was an earthquake. I felt it on the Rez. Six point nine. That mountain right there, Borah Peak, jumped  ten feet.” I pointed to highest outcrop of rock still covered in snow then swept my arm around to the west. “This whole valley tilted in just an instant.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I took a deep breath. “Imagine seeing that happen. The scarp is the scar where the ground broke. Look." I pointed to the thin while line demarking the valley from the mountain. "That line. It's not a road."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris grinned at me. "Can't ask a top to not follow his dick."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I grimaced at him, but took it as permission to lead the way. The road was worse than I expected. Heavy washboards, really dusty. Figured Chris'd be fuming about the dust on his bike by the time I stopped at the scarp.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I popped off my bike and ran to up to the trench. Canted slabs of prairie grass made a crazy mosaic chain along the base of the fifteen to twenty foot ribbon of a cliff. To the south, a dead tree held its slab of earth upside down, roots to the sky—probably tumbled over the edge. I scrambled up to the top of the cliff and looked out over the valley. Huge boulders stood sentinel a half mile out onto the plain. I scanned up slope for their origin, a rocky outcrop a couple thousand of feet up—goddamn, wish I could have seen it—what a rush.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My eyes followed the road back down to the bikes. Chris was leaning over his. Took me a moment to recognize what I saw. His had his leather riding pants down to his knees and he looked over his shoulder at me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"What the fuck are you doing?" I yelled down to him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He stood up and half turned to me. "C'mon. Let's use that hard-on that I know you've got."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I bounded down the steep slope in great leaps, landing bone jarringly hard at the bottom. Took just a few long steps to get my hand on his ass. “You got lube?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He back-handed me a black plastic film container.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I popped it open. Crisco. Fucked him right there on the side of the road  while I gazed in wonder at the fault scarp and imagined riding out an earthquake.</p>
