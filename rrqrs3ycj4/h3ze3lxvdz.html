            <h2 id="LostTrailHotSprings">Lost Trail Hot Springs</h2>
<p>We pulled into the campground just as I started to get hungry. Just a few camp spaces occupied. Chris likely chose the site more for the walking convenience to the lodge than any sense of wanting privacy.  We parked the bikes near a thick ponderosa.</p>
<p>Chris walked off to the office to rent the space.</p>
<p>I scoped out a place for my tent, rolled it out, unfolded it. The three fiberglass poles, shock corded, snapped themselves together. Slotting the pole ends into grommets sewn into the tent’s six corners, bowed the poles with tension. I ballooned the body of the ten by attaching the nylon clips to the poles’ cross over points. Sixty seconds later, my tent fully erected, I crawled in checking for level.  I had to pick it up to move a way from a bulging tree root. After testing it again, I staked it down. Done.</p>
<p>"Jesus, gone for two minutes and you've already moved in."</p>
<p>He surprised me, I hadn't seen him come back.</p>
<p>"What the fuck is that?" He gestured to my blue and white ripstop-nylon tent.</p>
<p>"It's my backpacking tent. What's wrong with it?"</p>
<p>"You packed some sort of NASA landing pod?" He examined the tensioned poles supporting themselves, the tent roof tightly suspended beneath them.</p>
<p>"It's a great tent. Really light, easy to carry for miles."</p>
<p>"Clever design. Goddamn." He pointed at the green canvas roll strapped to his bike’s sissy bar. "That ancient thing takes twenty minutes to assemble and will always collapse at least once during the night."</p>
<p>He refocused on my tent. "Look at the balanced tension on this.” He thrummed the arched pole as if it were a bass string. “It can't fucking fall down."</p>
<p>He looked at me. "You got room for two in there?"</p>
<p>I smiled. "Always."</p>
<hr>
<p>When Chris and I got into the hot tub, it only took a few minutes for everyone else to leave. The women, specifically, seemed to be really uncomfortable with us—if they only knew the truth.</p>
<p>After we were alone in the water, I asked, "Can ask something about Vince?"</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>"What was the deal between him and Acid?"</p>
<p>"Acid? Whaddaya mean?"</p>
<p>"Vince used to visit him in Deer Lodge. Everybody called him a fuck up." I huffed once. "What I really mean, uh, why does Vince keep accidentally calling me Acid?"</p>
<p>Chris didn't answer for a half a minute. "Vince fell for Acid way back. Long before I came into the picture.  They fucked around, but men weren't really Acid's thing, except when he was drunk or tripping. First love, though. Vince'll always have a soft spot for him."</p>
<p>He sighed, "I'm sorry that's happenin'. Yeah, everybody sees the similarities, but hell, he's gotta let it go. You're not Acid. I'll talk to him when we get back."</p>

<h2 id="1985-06-03-US-93South,Idaho">1985-06-03 - US-93 South, Idaho</h2>
<p>When we emerged from the canyon onto the broad barren Idaho valley on US93, I recognized the Big Lost River Valley. I immediately scanned the eastern face of the mountains for the fault scarp. Took me a moment to realize the whitish line at the base of the mountains wasn't a road.</p>
<p>I rolled the throttle, closed the distance with Chris, flipped the highbeam on to catch his attention. When I saw his brake tap acknowledgment, I raised my left arm in an arc over my head and pointed down to the right shoulder, the pull-over-signal.</p>
<p>Once stopped, I hopped off the bike and pulled my map from my pack. I checked back and forth between the map and the mountain wall east of the valley, Borah Peak—gotta get up there someday—highest point in Idaho.</p>
<p>Chris just stood there looking at me.</p>
<p>"I gotta do a side trip, I need to see the fault scarp."</p>
<p>He looked at me with resignation. “Winnemucca is a lotta hours away.</p>
<p>"About two miles ahead there's a dirt road that heads straight for that mountain. Only about two and half miles to it. I need to see it."</p>
<p>"What again do you need to see?"</p>
<p>"The fault scarp. Just a year and a half ago, there was an earthquake. I felt it on the Rez. Six point nine. That mountain right there, Borah Peak, jumped  ten feet.” I pointed to highest outcrop of rock still covered in snow then swept my arm around to the west. “This whole valley tilted in just an instant.”</p>
<p>I took a deep breath. “Imagine seeing that happen. The scarp is the scar where the ground broke. Look." I pointed to the thin while line demarking the valley from the mountain. "That line. It's not a road."</p>
<p>Chris grinned at me. "Can't ask a top to not follow his dick."</p>
<p>I grimaced at him, but took it as permission to lead the way. The road was worse than I expected. Heavy washboards, really dusty. Figured Chris'd be fuming about the dust on his bike by the time I stopped at the scarp.</p>
<p>I popped off my bike and ran to up to the trench. Canted slabs of prairie grass made a crazy mosaic chain along the base of the fifteen to twenty foot ribbon of a cliff. To the south, a dead tree held its slab of earth upside down, roots to the sky—probably tumbled over the edge. I scrambled up to the top of the cliff and looked out over the valley. Huge boulders stood sentinel a half mile out onto the plain. I scanned up slope for their origin, a rocky outcrop a couple thousand of feet up—goddamn, wish I could have seen it—what a rush.</p>
<p>My eyes followed the road back down to the bikes. Chris was leaning over his. Took me a moment to recognize what I saw. His had his leather riding pants down to his knees and he looked over his shoulder at me.</p>
<p>"What the fuck are you doing?" I yelled down to him.</p>
<p>He stood up and half turned to me. "C'mon. Let's use that hard-on that I know you've got."</p>
<p>I bounded down the steep slope in great leaps, landing bone jarringly hard at the bottom. Took just a few long steps to get my hand on his ass. “You got lube?"</p>
<p>He back-handed me a black plastic film container.</p>
<p>I popped it open. Crisco. Fucked him right there on the side of the road  while I gazed in wonder at the fault scarp and imagined riding out an earthquake.</p>

<h2 id="Winnemucca,Nevada">Winnemucca, Nevada</h2>
<p>"C'mon, let's get some dinner and hit the card tables." Chris stood at the door of the motel room, ready to walk out.</p>
<p>"I can't afford to play poker here," I countered. Can’t afford to lose money—I needed to save for grad school.</p>
<p>"Jesus, it's not Vegas. They gotta keep the truckers & miners playin’ here. C'mon, you can afford to drop a C note."</p>
<p>I followed him out the door and down to the restaurant next to the casino. Every square foot of carpeting, where a normal business would put a potted plant or a chair, instead had a slot machine.</p>
<p>The mix of customers spanned from exhausted parents on car trips with kids to longhaul truckers laying over for fuel, food, and gambling. Nobody looked like a high roller. Everybody looked stressed.</p>
<p>The steak dinner lived up to its low price, the baked potato did not. They didn’t make their money from selling food: the slots were everywhere.</p>
<p>After eating, we hiked through the casino to the poker tables in the back. They had three running seven card. Chris picked the table and we sat waiting for the hand in progress to finish. We each bought in for a hundred.</p>
<p>I got comfortable way quicker than I expected. The no limits game here were no more intimidating than the no-limits games back at the Horse. Nobody made outrageous bets.</p>
<p>I settled into the rhythm and focus of making money, not winning hands. Very few of these players would I have classified as good. Chris and I both sucked money from the other players.</p>
<p>We had a couple fun standoffs with each other. The first favored him, the second favored me. I realized this was the first time I had ever played cards with a friend. David had never been one—so fortunate to have these people in my life.</p>
<p>Our last game that night ended like this:</p>
<p>On fifth street, the guy to my left, guessing worked for one of the mines, held the high board. He checked.</p>
<p>All but the woman at the far end folded. She bet $10.</p>
<p>"You can't bluff me." Chris eyed me sideways and raised to $20.</p>
<p>I gestured to the pot. "Bet I can." I raised it to $40.</p>
<p>The guy to my left folded. With a sour pinched expression, the woman at the end folded, too. She glared at us.</p>
<p>Chris frowned at me, too, then called.</p>
<p>"Heads up on sixth street." The dealer’s code to announce a one on one game as he snapped out the next up-cards.</p>
<p>Chris now had "A♣, K♦, A♠, 5♣" showing.</p>
<p>The "K♥" dealt to me did nothing for my hand, but it sure made my board look dangerous: "7♥, 9♥, J♥, K♥"</p>
<p>Seventh street started our battle. My hole cards now " 7♦, 9♦, 7♣" with my board gave me a full house. I loved seeing my up-cards tell a completely different story.</p>
<p>Chris started the bet, with a dismissive glance at my cards: $20. By the time our tit for tat raises settled out, I was just short of all in.</p>
<p>The showdown made us both laugh. My "7♦, 7♣, 7♥, 9♦, 9♥" smashed his "A♥, A♣, A♠, K♦, 6♦"</p>
<p>The dealer raked the pot to me.</p>
<p>"You pulled that out of your fucking ass," Chris quipped.</p>
<p>"And shoved it right up yours. I'm the top, remember?" Kinda shocked at myself for saying that out loud in front of the other players.</p>
<p>"I'm cashing out." I looked up to the dealer. He racked and counted my tokes, passed the cash back to me. I turned to Chris, "I'm tired.  Long ride today."</p>
<p>Chris nodded, then cashed out, too. We both tipped the dealer very well.</p>

<p>The ride to Reno was hot. I shed my jacket, as the sweat inside felt parboiling. Riding without it, though, seemed like the recipe for jerky, moving air, 105 degrees,</p>
