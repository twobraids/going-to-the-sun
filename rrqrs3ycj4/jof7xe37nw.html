            <h2 id="MariasPass,Montana">Marias Pass, Montana</h2>
<p>The idea came to me back in June, when David and I did our first ride around the south end of the Park and then back over Going to the Sun. We had stopped at the top of Marias pass where a westbound train had stopped before contiunuing. I realized at that time that the the freight trains never just crested the pass and moved on. They always stopped for an inspection. I assumed this must be for some required safety rule. They didn't want trains losing control and careening down the pass out of control.</p>
<p>I had gone up to the top of the pass a dozen times to verify if that was, indeed, the standard practice. Never once in all the hours I spent up there had I seen a westbound train fail to stop.</p>
<hr>
<p>I needed a place to get onto the train. It was no good if I'd have to go all the way back to East Glacier Park Station and hope a freight would stop in town for my boarding convenience. It turns out that the tight curve at the start of my daily walk was the key. The trains always slowed to nearly a walking pace around that curve. Testament to the tightness and stress of the curve, broken steel knuckles, the connectors between rail cars, littered ground on either side of the tracks.</p>
<p>I started to watch freight trains for other riders. What railcar type did the hobos exploit? Open box cars seemed to be the choice. If they used other types of cars, I never managed to see them.</p>
<p>Now how could I get into an open box car? They're really too high to jump into while they're moving. I experimented by getting as close to a moving train as I could by standing on the edge of the track ballast. Box car floors are about four feet above the railroad ties, but the ballast slopes down quickly on the edge of the track: horribly unstable footing. I saw no way to get a running start for a sideways leap and I cannot imagine a standing leap into a moving boxcar wearing ski boots.</p>
<p>Thinking back to my childhood, I recall seeing a program about how railroads workStanding out in my memory were railroad workers hanging on the side of rolling boxcars and blithely jumping on and off at will to operate switches and brakes. Could I hang onto the side of a boxcar for ten miles in the winter weather?</p>
<p>I practiced for the rest of the summer jumping on and off that little stirrup and ladder welded to both ends of railroad cars. Getting on was relatively easy as long as I kept my footing. The problem I foresaw was hanging on. Riding even for a few moments was rougher than I expected. It was terrifying to be so close to those huge crushing wheels, I could imagine the catastrophic consequences of losing my grip. Since the use of cabooses on trains stopped that year, I switched to riding the very last car of the train. It seemed to be an even rougher ride, but the consequences of falling were less dire as I would be behind the last wheel.</p>
<p>However, I was still concerned about losing my grip. In the winter, those steel rungs might be extremely cold. The solution was a couple carabiners purchased from a climbing shop. My backpack had a chest strap with attachment loops of nylon webbing. Threading a carabiner through, I found I could lock myself to the ladder rung.</p>
<p>I did a trial run of my scheme in September before the snows started. I rode my motorcycle up to the top of the pass and stashed it in the woods near a highway pullout. I hitchhiked the ten miles back home.</p>
<p>I immediately walked up the gravel road to the tracks to wait for a train. When one passed by, I smoothly mounted my chosen boxcar at the end of the train, clipped myself on and hung on for the ride up the pass. It was terrifying but thrilling and totally hilarious. I laughed like a madman all the way up the pass. At the top, the train slowed to a stop. I unhitched myself, jumped off and casually walked around the rear of the train. I traversed down the slope to the highway pullout, retrieved my bike from the woods and rode home. It was a complete success.</p>
