            <h2 id="RailroadCreekRanch">Railroad Creek Ranch</h2>
<p>The rumble of Harleys rolled up from the highway, knocking me out of my book. My eyes just traced that same sentence over and over, so it really didn't matter.  Moment by moment, they got closer. I heard them slow for the turnoff onto the gravel at the Railroad Creek Ranch. Not just passing through.  Not tourists; Gladys's restaurant doesn't open this early at the end of the tourist season. I expected these bikes. Two of them. Didn't sound like the choppers—more like the baggers.</p>
<p>I sighed heavily, bracing for the questions about my bruised, swollen face. I stepped out the front door and waited as they crawled up my rutted access road. Vince appeared first, cresting the hump where the road finally leveled out in front of my cabin. Surprised, I recognized Dolph riding up behind Vince, not Chris, as I had expected.</p>
<p>Dolph doesn't talk much. In my four weeks dealing at the Iron Horse last month, I never once had an actual conversation with him. He works the door, breaks up the fights, and ejects the troublemakers. He's one of the muscle guys of the club, a fixture in the bar, always watching everything and everyone. I’m a guy of words; his silence intimidates me more than his sheer physical presence.</p>
<p>Dolph held short on the road as Vince wheeled his bike around to park so his front tire faced outward. I recalled doing that by instinct on that second night at Vince and Chris's place. Dolph duplicated the maneuver, bringing his bike perfectly parallel with Vince's. With their backs to me, I saw they both rode colors: Bitterroot Bastards MC.</p>
<p>Vince dismounted, turned, and stepped toward me. His happy-to-see-me grin quickly fell into a concerned frown. "Karl, what the fuck happened to you?"</p>
<p>He closed the distance in two strides, put one enormous paw on my shoulder as if to hold me in place. He examined my black and blue swollen face and my one working eye as if he were surveying the engine of a damaged bike. I started to pull away, but found myself backed up against my own front door.</p>
<p>"I had an accident."</p>
<p>"Bullshit, that ain't from a fuckin' accident. Who did this to you?"</p>
<p>I stayed silent, suddenly feeling intimidated by my friends.</p>
<p>Dolph stepped up beside Vince, joining in the examination. "Four, maybe five hits. Guy wears a ring."</p>
<p>Raising his voice, Vince repeated, "Who did this to you?"</p>
<p>I took in a deep breath. "David. I did something really, really dumb. Walked right into it."</p>
<p>"David. David Meyer? Your buddy from the poker table at the Horse?" Vince looked furious, and that scared me.</p>
<p>I gaped. Vince could only have heard the name once or twice—no way he could have known David's last name. I didn't even know it until I saw the letters on his table two days ago.</p>
<p>"Yes, David did this." My voice barely a whisper from the shame that I felt.</p>
<p>Vince shook his head. "Cabin in Heart Butte. Apartment in Great Falls. Drives for Montana Wholesale Grocers Association. Western Conference Teamster. Army vet, medical psych discharge. Way over his head in debt."</p>
<p>Vince and Dolph turned toward each other, exchanging a look. Vince nodded, saying under his breath, "We're takin' this fucker down."</p>
<p>"How do you know all this?"</p>
<p>"We’re trackin’ him. Remember that first morning after we met? One of Sarah’s girls got worked over—same motel your buddies stayed at."</p>
<p>"I remember hearin' you guys talk about that. I didn't pay much attention." I kept the rest to myself—Ted's warning, making the connection myself after my escape. Didn't matter now. They'd already pegged him, they didn't need to know my part.</p>
<p>Vince looked at me as if making an appraisal. “Karl, you ain't got no clue how to defend yourself, do you?  Can’t have you walking around this vulnerable. We gotta fix this."</p>
<p>Vince turned back to Dolph. "Grab the hose and oil from my saddlebag. Get the Ironhead running. Karl and I got a conversation to finish inside—then we’re heading to Heart Butte."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>
<p>"Let's take this inside."</p>
<p>I turned, opened the door. Housekeeping was never my priority—it showed. My backcountry pack that I dropped two nights ago still lay on the floor, nearly blocking the door from opening. I shoved it aside with my foot and started clearing a spot for us on the sofa.</p>
<p>Vince stopped me, gesturing me to him. I stepped up and he enveloped me in his arms, holding me tightly. I flashed suddenly to David’s hug before he started hitting. I struggled, pushed against Vince. He released his arms, letting me escape. Two steps back, I stopped myself, feeling confusion and panic.</p>
<p>“Shit. The fucker did more than just bust up your face.  Karl, it ain’t gonna be easy for you, but we gotta talk about this.” He stepped into my kitchen and started looking around. "S'pose like last time, you ain't got no coffee."</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry, I don't buy it. I won't spend money on what I don't need.”</p>
<p>"Forget it. Don't worry about that right now. I'll get it later. Sit down. Walk me through it. I want the whole damn story—start to finish.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath and told him how it happened. I explained our ride: David's constant drinking, him moving out, the seizure notice, the war trauma, the land mine, his scars, and, finally, Derick.</p>
<p>“Jesus fuckin’ Christ. I get why you feel for the bastard, but that don’t mean shit. No fuckin’ excuse for what he did—to you, to Linda. Did he get his dick in ya'?"</p>
<p>"No. When I came to, he was trying, but it was like he didn't know how to do it, or his dick wasn't hard enough. Maybe too drunk to figure it out. Or maybe my ass is too tight." I threw my hands up as emphasis of having no clue.</p>
<p>"You should’ve told me this yesterday. I knew something was off by your voice on the phone.”</p>
<p>"I was talking on the payphone in front of the grocery store—tourists all around. What was I supposed to do looking all bruised like this, shout out that some guy tried to fuck my ass?"</p>
<p>"Don’t like you holed up out here on the East Side. No phone, no backup, nobody to step in if shit goes sideways.  You’re mine now—soon to be a brother, that makes you my responsibility. You sure you won’t think about moving west? I know you like your isolation. Bet we could find you a pitch up near Hungry Horse, maybe up the North Fork toward Polebridge."</p>
<p>Too many things at once: You're mine now. What the hell?</p>
<p>"I love this place. I'm not done here." My mind flashed on that miles-long line of survey stakes marking out a road where there ought not to be one—another damned exploratory natural gas borehole in the wilderness. "I dunno, we'll talk about it, just not right now.  What are you and Dolph going to do?"</p>
<p>“Like I told ya', we’re headin’ to Heart Butte. Planned this before you even called yesterday. We'll see if he cleared out. If he’s gone, we leave a message in case he comes back. If he’s still there—well, the three of us gonna have a talk. If he don’t feel like talkin’… I got a ball-peen hammer that’ll change his mind. How’s he fixed for guns?"</p>
<p>"I know he's got ‘em. I saw him pack two up in a case and put them in his truck. I don't think he'll ever be back there. I saw the land seizure notice."</p>
<p>Vince nodded. "You wearin' your pledge patch when you rode with him?"</p>
<p>"No. You said I shouldn't wear it on the Honda. I never told David that I'm a prospect for the club. On Saturday, I suggested that we ride to Columbia Falls to get the parts to fix the Sportster. He didn't want to have anything to do with goin’ there... I guess I know why now."</p>
<p>At that moment, we heard the Sportster start up, rev a few times and then settle down into an idle. Dolph had done his work quickly.</p>
<p>“From now on, any time you’re out—either bike—you wear that patch. No exceptions. We ain’t got rivals here. Renegados are movin’ north, but they’re still down in Wyoming and Idaho. Nothin’ for ‘em up this far north on the rez."</p>
<p>He fixed his eyes on me. "If they got scouts pokin’ around, they’ll see your patch. Might recognize it. Won’t fuck with you. That’s the point. I want you showin’—clear as day—you’re under our protection.”</p>
<p>"How'd you find out all that information about David?"</p>
<p>"That’s Sarah’s work. Woman’s got a knack for diggin’ up information.”</p>
<p>I thought about that for a few seconds. "You've checked me out too, haven't you?"</p>
<p>“’Course we have. Dealer’s license opened all those doors. I know you ain’t got no record. Worked a summer for Montana Power. No debt, but no credit either. Went to college in Bozeman and Missoula—degree’s from Missoula. I know who your old man is—big-shot lawyer down there."</p>
<p>He looked at me hard. "What I’m guessin’, he never taught you shit about the real world. I know you’re driftin’. Like a young pup, run outta the pack before you were ready. I'm gonna fix that."</p>
<p>I just looked at him through my one open eye. "You know, David is going to be here on Friday. He drives the truck that supplies Gladys's restaurant."</p>
<p>"Didn’t know that." Vince thought for a minute and then grew a wicked grin. “Changes things. You know his route? Other places he supplies?”</p>
<p>"Not really, but expect most every commercial kitchen and grocery store around.  I know he said he supplied the Park concessions."</p>
<p>Vince's smile widened. He looked as if he had it all planned out. "Sarah’ll get his route and schedule. Got an idea—gonna pull the whole club in, give him a shove in the right direction. County and his company’ll do the rest."</p>
<p>"You're gonna have somebody here when he comes on Friday?"</p>
<p>"I'll be here. Probably Dolph. Maybe Andy, too. The fucker ain't gettin' within a quarter mile of you."</p>
<p>I took a deep breath. For forty-eight hours, the fear had festered deep in my gut. Hearing Vince's words, I felt a flame ignite within me. Have I been waiting for permission to get angry?</p>
<p>"Listen up. Dolph and I are headin’ down to Heart Butte to check things out. Be gone a couple hours. You stay put. Need us to bring you anything? You got grub, you set?"</p>
<p>"I have no ice. I need a pack for my face to get the swelling down. I couldn't bear going down to get some from Gladys. I've only got canned stuff to eat. I don't want to show my face at the market in town. I was gonna go in after I called you yesterday. I couldn't do it. I don't want the attention."</p>
<p>"You got it. Couple hours." Vince stood up and moved toward the door.</p>
<p>As I stood up, Vince turned around, put his hand on my shoulder. "You're OK. I'm gonna make things right."</p>
<p>I felt so lucky for stumbling on such a champion for myself. Yeah, some quiet background part of me wanted to defend David, it's not his fault he's so broken. At the same time, I really wanted to know that Vince and Dolph beat the crap out of him. He gets what he deserves.</p>
<p>Two roads ahead of me—like I could see into two futures, both already unfolding. One where I stood by David, made excuses for the damage he did because I understood the damage done to him. It wasn’t his fault he was broken—he didn’t ask for the war, the ghosts, the poison in his head. I wanted to shield him, to take his side even now.</p>
<p>But the other road—hell, I was already walking it. I saw Vince and Dolph head off to break him— part of me wanted them to do it—needed them to. I pictured David on the ground, bloodied and humiliated, and I felt both guilt and relief.</p>
<p>I followed Vince out the door to find Dolph standing by the bikes, smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p>Dolph spoke up to Vince as he approached. "Bike’s fine. Checked out the place. More hidden than defensible. Hard to hit from uphill, but doable. Trail east drops to a bunch of tourist cabins. Out back—two trails. One goes up past a fire pit. Meadows, beaver ponds, no roads. Didn’t scope West trail yet."</p>
<p>I never had heard so many words from Dolph at once.  Vince nodded his approval of Dolph's report and mounted his bike. Dolph followed suit.</p>
<p>They started the bikes up, a mechanical rumble—alien and unwelcome reverberating in the forest. I watched them disappear down the road, suddenly feeling quite alone.  I couldn’t have stopped them—did I want to stop them?</p>
<p>I wandered back inside and looked at my book on the floor. I longed to be out somewhere standing on a ridge, knowing nobody was within twenty miles of me. I wanted isolation while at the same time I didn’t want Vince to go.</p>
<p>You’re mine now. What have I gotten myself into?</p>
<h2 id="BearCountry">Bear Country</h2>
<p>Internal conflict always means I needed to go out to walk. I stepped over to my backpack by the door, opened it, pulled out my jacket, put it on, then slipped out the back door. I chose the left trail up to my fire pit, but passed it by. Feeling a bit odd that Dolph walked my trail without asking me first, I kept climbing. A few minutes later, I emerged at the plateau where the grade suddenly levels off: a hanging valley courtesy of a ten thousand year dead glacier.</p>
<p>The trees opened up revealing a beaver pond a hundred yards from drop off. I could hear the water flowing through their dam, forming the cascade that cut the gully down the bench east of my cabin. I turned right, edging between the forest and the reeds to a peninsula that jutted into the pond.</p>
<p>A beaver, having noticed me, slapped the water as a warning of my presence to his clan. The peninsula formed from sediment collecting around a tree that fell long ago into the pond. Its rotting trunk made several great places to sit in the afternoon sun. I sat in my usual hollow, watching the pond and meadow behind it. The beavers got used to me and continued their daily routines.</p>
<p>I woke up with a change in the direction of the wind, surprised I had fallen asleep. The scent brought me around instantly, like a thousand rank gym socks. I sat up and started speaking out loud. "I'm here, bear. You need to know that I'm here. I don't know where you are, but this would be a great time to run away. I'm here, bear."</p>
<p>It’s never a good idea to be silent in grizzly country. That’s always frustrated me—making noise drives off the wildlife, robbing me of the viewing opportunity. That’s the trade-off. This is bear country, and no glimpse of an animal is worth the risk of startling the wrong kind.</p>
<p>"I'm still here, bear, just minding my own business. I hope you are too."</p>
<p>A beaver slapped the water on the far side of the pond. I spun, but all I caught was the widening ring of ripples. My mind flicked to my .44—useless, tucked away in my pack back at the cabin. I started back along the pond’s edge toward my trail, keeping up a steady stream of nonsense just to make noise. Sometimes I sing, but not today.</p>
<p>"I'm not your enemy, bear. I'm not your dinner, bear."</p>
<p>Another beaver slap shattered the quiet, this time much closer. I barely had time to register it before a movement caught my one usable eye.</p>
<p>The bear. Grizzly. Far end of the pond, perfectly upwind. Maybe forty yards out. Still on all fours, head up, sniffing the air—looking right at me.</p>
<p>I longed for my temporarily disabled depth perception.</p>
<p>I kept walking and talking, though now I relaxed a bit knowing its location. I knew it could hear me, but it couldn't smell me. The wind direction betrayed it to me, not me to it. Perfect combination to make it nervous and wander away instead of investigating.</p>
<p>I got to the point where my trail dropped over the edge down to my cabin. I imagined if the bear could see me, I just suddenly vanished. No longer talking, I hiked back down to my cabin in silence, assuming out of sight, out of hearing, out of mind. In every bear encounter I had in the last two years, they always ran. I added one more notch to my mental tally stick.</p>
<p>I got to my cabin and slipped in the back door. I pulled the .44 from the side pocket of the pack and put it on the table.</p>
<p>I climbed into the loft and curled up with my book. I still couldn't focus on reading.</p>
<h2 id="RailroadCreekRestaurant">Railroad Creek Restaurant</h2>
<p>The sound of Harleys arriving again woke me. Trying to clear my head, I got up, shambled over to the ladder, and climbed down into the front room. I stepped through my front door just as they finished parking their bikes in front of the deck. As Vince got off the bike and turned toward me, we locked eyes, well, only one eye for me. He shook his head, but that didn't really tell me what had happened.</p>
<p>He opened his saddlebag and pulled out a bag of ice. Dolph pulled two paper bags of groceries from his. I opened the door wide for them to walk in.</p>
<p>"He wasn't there. The place is trashed." Vince dropped the ice bag in the sink. “Left some papers. I grabbed them. I guess he’s holed up in Great Falls. We’ll check if he showed up at work. I’m not heading to Great Falls today. It’s more important to be here for you."</p>
<p>Dolph set the grocery bags on the table and, of course, immediately focused on my Smith & Wesson. "Your gun needs cleaning."</p>
<p>Vince whipped around in the kitchenette and stepped over to the table to see. After taking a look, he turned to me. “I wouldn’t have pegged you as a gun owner."</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm always in the high country around here. This is grizzly habitat. There was one up the hill by the beaver ponds thirty minutes ago. I'm not so much of an idiot that I'd be traipsing around here without protection."</p>
<p>Dolph surprised the hell out of me by suddenly looking wide-eyed and apprehensive. He moved to the nearest window and peered out.</p>
<p>Vince looked hard at me. "You trained?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I took the shooting course at the Hellgate Canyon firing range before I moved here."</p>
<p>I got up and walked into the kitchen and started pawing through the cabinets looking for my ice pack. I found it and commenced stuffing it with the ice in the sink. I shoved the remains of the bag in the freezer. I walked back into the front room with a dish towel and the ice pack. I got onto the sofa, kicked off some more junk off to make room, and stretched out. I put the towel on my face and gently applied the ice pack.</p>
<p>"Dolph, I'm going to spend the night here. Gotta take care of Karl."</p>
<p>I opened my one eye and looked at Vince with mixed feelings—yes, absolutely I wanted him to stay the night, but him deciding that without asking me first annoyed me. That’s just like David, always telling me, never asking me. He met my gaze and I nodded my assent anyway.</p>
<p>Vince turned back to Dolph. "Head on back to Whitefish. Appreciate you backing me today. Tell Sarah and Chris what happened.”</p>
<p>Dolph nodded to Vince, but then turned to me, “Next time you’re at the Horse, bring your gun. I’ll clean it.”</p>
<p>"I'll do that. Thank you, Dolph." I nodded to him from under my ice and he returned it in kind.</p>
<p>Dolph left without another word. After a few moments, I heard his bike start and he took off down the hill.</p>
<p>I listened to Dolph’s progress until his acceleration on the highway westbound. "I really don't get that man.”</p>
<p>"Yeah, he’s an odd one. I trust him with my life. Might be the most loyal man I’ve ever known—no questions, no hesitation."</p>
<p>"He's scared of grizzly bears though?"</p>
<p>Vince laughed. "Yeah, you saw that. No clue why. Man’d stand his ground against a freight train, but bears spook him."</p>
<p>He paused for a moment clearly thinking about Dolph. "Ask him about his artwork. Man lights up like a goddamn beacon. Keeps a little spiral pad in his pocket, sketches with a pencil. Like his brain catches every damn detail, won’t let go. He can just put it on paper like a photograph."</p>
<p>"What’s 'Dolph' short for?"</p>
<p>"Dolph came outta some commune on the California coast—Mendocino, I think. His folks named him Dolphin, of all goddamn things. No clue what their deal was. Don’t even know if they’re still around. He don't talk much."</p>
<p>Vince started unpacking the two grocery bags. I watched from the sofa as he struggled with where to put things. There are only two cabinets in my kitchen, one for food, the other for pots, plates, glasses, and all my kitchen utensils. He took a box of breakfast cereal from a shopping bag and found it too tall for the shelf. “Where should I put this?”</p>
<p>“Lucky Charms? You bought me a box of Lucky Charms?”</p>
<p>“I have no clue what you eat. Chris loves these things.” He looked at the box and then over to me. “What, you don’t like ‘em?”</p>
<p>“To be honest, I don’t think I’ve eaten them since I was a little kid. How about you take them back to Chris as a gift?”</p>
<p>Vince shrugged and left them on the table.</p>
<p>For the next hour, I lay on the couch just drifting, not talking. Vince stepped out the front door and didn't return for quite a while. Not exactly asleep when he came in, I sat up. The ice pack had melted.</p>
<p>"Vince, why doesn't the accounting of the bar and the club make any sense?"</p>
<p>"What'd ya mean?"</p>
<p>"That bar couldn't make enough money to support that house you guys have. I can't figure where the money's coming from. How does the club make money?"</p>
<p>"We got our ways. The Horse makes a lot more than you'd think. 'specially the poker tables."</p>
<p>"What about Sarah's girls? I watched 'em in the bar while I was dealing. There's only six of 'em. They can't be bringing in much."</p>
<p>"They ain’t bringin’ in a dime for us. Sarah don’t take a cut. They keep what they make. She finds ’em work—takes care of ’em when they need it. Once she figured out it was David, she wanted t'kill him. When she hears he got you too… Might not be able to stop her."</p>
<p>Not what I expected to hear. "Seriously, Vince, it still doesn't add up. I'm already up to my ass in this, and before I sink any deeper, I think if I'm gonna be a brother, I deserve to know."</p>
<p>"Bar ain’t the only business we got. Club either. Chris runs the operation that brings in most of the money."</p>
<p>"And what is that?"</p>
<p>"VHS tapes. Chris grew up in LA, got all kinds of studio connections. Got sources where to get the gear."</p>
<p>"He bootlegs movies?"</p>
<p>"No. He’s got his own company. Shoots his own stuff."</p>
<p>I thought for a moment. "Porn?" I nodded my head as that could be the only answer.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Big money in tapes. Him and Sarah run it together. Got a studio in Van Nuys. Sarah’s thinkin' 'bout settin’ up another in Reno."</p>
<p>"Not what I expected you to say."</p>
<p>"What’d you expect?"</p>
<p>"I figured there would be a drug connection."</p>
<p>"No fuckin’ way. Too hot. That’s why we split with George in ‘75. Club’s about watchin’ out for each other, not puttin’ us in the fire."</p>
<p>I nodded, wondering if he told the whole story. He certainly clung to that protection line.</p>
<p>"Thank you for being here, Vince. I don't think I'd be doing well by myself right now."</p>
<p>Vince smiled. "Got your back. Always will."</p>
<p>My stomach growled and I realized I had barely eaten anything today. "What time is it?"</p>
<p>"About six. You wanna get somethin' to eat? What's that place down the hill like? We didn’t hit it when me and Chris were here in July."</p>
<p>"It's meatloaf night. Once a week, I go down there about eight when they close. Gladys gives me the leftovers of whatever special she made that day. It's okay. Saves me money."</p>
<p>"How ‘bout we head down there as customers tonight?"</p>
<p>"I don't want to go down there looking like this."</p>
<p>"Karl, you’re gonna look like that for a coupla weeks. You hidin’ out the whole damn time? C’mon, let’s go down there."</p>
<p>I thought about it a while and wondered how Gladys would react with me walking in looking beaten with a patched biker in tow. What the hell. Like I said, I'm already waist deep in this shit.</p>
<p>"Okay. I'm gonna change first." I stepped into my back bedroom and switched to some better jeans. Returning to the front room, I saw Vince had put his leather jacket with the Bastards overlay on. I didn't comment, thought for a second to wear mine, but then dismissed the idea.</p>
<p>We stepped out the door, and I led toward the trail. Vince followed. The walk only took a few minutes. Vince looked uncomfortable and awkward leaping over the creek.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, we ascended the steps up to the restaurant door. I pushed it open, bracing for the reaction. It came. Kathy looked up, gasped, and her eyes were wide. “Karl, what happened to you?" Then she saw the towering bulk of Vince, and she drew back.</p>
<p>"I had a run-in with a drunk." I gestured to Vince and gave a half smile. "I've hired a bodyguard."</p>
<p>Vince laughed.</p>
<p>"You want a table?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>She grabbed a pair of menus and took us to one of the window booths with the view of Calf Robe Mountain in the Park across the valley. We sat on either side of the table. I let Vince have the view seat as I saw that mountain every day.  I didn't bother opening my menu; I just waited for Vince.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Kathy took our order to the kitchen.</p>
<p>As we waited, I gestured to the view. "I climbed to the top of that peak a last summer. A couple times, I figured I was gonna die. I should have had a rope in that last pitch to the top."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0154" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Gladys backed through the swinging door from the kitchen, deftly pivoting and making a straight line to our table. She dealt the plates with practiced flair like I dealt cards back at the bar.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0155" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Her mouth pinched tight as she laid eyes on my black-and-blue face—here comes the lecture. My eyes dropped to the table—best to keep my head down. Vince's astonished expression stopped me cold.</p>
<p>"Gladys? Gladys Burnside?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0157" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Derailed from her lecture, Gladys turned, confused. She hesitated. "Yes?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0158" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince smiled, calm and certain. "Silver Bow Motorcycles."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0159" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Gladys froze. Her mouth opened slightly as it hit her. She nearly shrieked, "Vince! Oh, my Lord!"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0160" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince stood up from the table, reaching out. They hugged.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0161" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I just sat there—watching.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0162" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>How the fuck could they know one another? Two entirely separate planes of my life had crashed together in front of me. Big state, tiny population.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0163" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I certainly had never seen Gladys looking so flustered—or so torn—when they drew apart.</p>
<p>She looked up to Vince. "I've got food on the grill. I gotta get back to the kitchen. I'll be back in five minutes." She turned away and disappeared through the swinging kitchen door.  Vince returned to his seat, still looking back at the door.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0165" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I just watched him, waiting for his explanation.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0166" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>His distant eyes lingered for a few moments before he started speaking. "Back in ‘55, she married one of my club brothers in Butte. That was before we merged—Silver Bow MC and Bitterroot MC outta Missoula. Ed was dead set against it. Patched out. Left in good standing, no trouble."</p>
<p>"Ed was her late husband’s name."</p>
<p>"Ah, he's gone now." A brief flush of sadness crossed his face.  "I remember she had a baby in ‘56 and maybe another in ‘58." Vince's expression slowly transformed to wistful. He hovered over his plate in reverie.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0169" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I started on my meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Gladys really made good gravy, though she really overcooked the vegetables.</p>
<p>"Your meatloaf is getting cold."</p>
<p>He gave himself a slight shake, and his eyes refocused on me. "Sorry, just thinkin'." He started eating.</p>
<p>We didn't even get halfway through our meal before Gladys came back out to deliver plates to the couple that came in after us. She came right over to our table. With a head gesture, she signaled me to move over, as she wanted to sit across from Vince. I shifted toward the window wall, and she sat next to me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0173" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She looked like she had an urgent question, all knitted brow and steely eyes. "Were you in prison? We heard about the..." She paused. "...murders and arrests."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0174" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No." Vince shook his head hard.  "Back in '70, Sarah and I moved up to Columbia Falls and opened a bar—"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0175" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"That girl from the carnival? You got married?" Gladys leaned forward on the table looking perplexed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0176" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah, Sarah and I have always been together. But we split from George in ‘75. Washed our hands of him. None of us went down in that mess."</p>
<p>Gladys pushed back into the seat. "You and George were so close."</p>
<p>"Wasn’t the same guy we knew. Lost sight of what we stood for."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0179" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Hearing about the deaths and arrests broke Ed’s heart." She let out a long sigh. "He died in a car wreck near Great Falls, maybe ten years back. Drove too damn fast, always did. I used to holler at him for it."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0180" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I remember." Vince's eyes went distant again. “That drag race in Billings, he smoked ’em. Hell of a mechanic. Solid guy. Sorry he’s gone.” He refocused on her. “So how’d you two end up way out here?”</p>
<p>"Ed found this land and restaurant for sale back in ‘58. We always dreamed of running our own business, a café. Tourist trade’s been good to us. But I’m gettin’ too damn old to run it alone. Don’t think my kids’ll take it over. Maybe I’ll sell in a couple years."</p>
<p>They kept on talking while I finished my plate. I got restless after that. I interrupted their conversation. "I'm gonna head back up to the cabin, lie down, and put some ice on my face. You two keep talking."</p>
<p>Vince looked to me with concern. "You okay to walk back on your own?"</p>
<p>"Of course, I am. I can still see."</p>
<p>Gladys looked back and forth between us. "What’s the deal between you two? How the hell do you know each other?"</p>
<p>Vince spoke up before I could. "Guess you didn’t know—Karl’s a hell of a poker player. We hired him on, he’s been dealin’ for us at the Iron Horse in Columbia Falls. Me ‘n Sarah run the place. Got him set up as a prospect for the Bastards."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0187" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Karl? In an MC?" She shook her head. "Well, hell. Sure did take to riding like a duck to water. He looks the part. Never figured he’d take the bike out after sayin’ he didn’t know how to ride."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0188" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince turned his head abruptly to me. It’s easy to hold my poker face when my face hurts so much.</p>
<p>Just then, a group of six people entered the front door where Kathy greeted them. The noise level in the dining room raised significantly.</p>
<p>“I’ve gotta get back to the kitchen. How long you stickin' 'round, Vince?"</p>
<p>"‘Til I know Karl’s okay on his own. The MC still takes care of their own.”</p>
<p>"Swing by tomorrow mornin’, ‘round ten. Wanna sit down with coffee, talk a bit? Catch up on some of the folks we knew back then."</p>
<p>Vince nodded, and a moment later, we all stood by the table. Gladys looked Vince up and down once and moved to hug him again. "Last time I saw you, you were what—eighteen? Damn, years fly by now."</p>
<p>Vince smiled. She retired to her kitchen, and we walked out of the restaurant.</p>
<p>The sun always set earlier than it should around here. While we’ve got a pretty clear line of sight to the Eastern horizon, the West is blocked a third of the way into the sky by the mountains of the continental divide. The sun still shone on sheer rock cliffs of Calf Robe Mountain. First light snows of the oncoming winter caught the waning sunlight.</p>
<p>We walked back to the trail up to my cabin in silence.</p>
<h2 id="PrairieHomeCompanion">Prairie Home Companion</h2>
<p>On arriving at the cabin, I headed straight for the woodshed. “It feels like we’re heading for a freeze tonight. I need to get some more wood for the stove.”</p>
<p>“How much do you need to bring in?”</p>
<p>“Just a couple of armloads. Some for tonight and some for morning.”</p>
<p>“I’ll get it. You go on in.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got enough inside to get started.” I stepped in—not too dark yet. I had enough light to shovel out last night’s ashes into the bucket, lay kindling, and light the night's fire.</p>
<p>Vince walked in with an armload of wood and dropped it into the woodbox near the stove. "Gettin' dark in here."</p>
<p>"I can start the generator if you want some light. I only need it when I'm reading. I don't imagine that you brought anything to read."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0206" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Ah, it's Monday night. We can get the Missoula public radio station here on the rez. They rerun Prairie Home Companion on Monday nights. You wanna listen to that?"</p>
<p>"Don't know what it is."</p>
<p>"We'll do that. I'll get a radio set up. Once I'm sure the fire is going good, I'll dampen it down, and we can hang out up in the loft to listen."</p>
<p>When the program ended two hours later, we were lying together on the mattress on the floor in the loft. I could only lie on my right side. Vince laid on his left side facing me. Not hugging me, just resting his tattoo covered arm on me, occasionally stroking me.</p>
<p>He spoke up. "Didn’t know stuff like that was still on the radio. Used to lie in Ma’s trailer, listenin’ to the programs on the Philco. It had this big dial on it. She'd get mad as hell if I so much as touched it. Feels like a whole other life. Can we hear this in Columbia Falls?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure there's a repeater station in Kalispell. It's live on Saturday afternoons. On FM, look at the left end of the dial. Public radio stations always seem to have low frequencies."</p>
<p>"Vince, can I ask you a question?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>"How did you get your scar? I didn't realize how far it reached back into your hair."</p>
<p>"Carnival accident. Changed everything in my life." He took a deep breath. “You really wanna hear it?”</p>
<p>“I am curious about your past. I’ve no idea what growing up in a carnival would be like.”</p>
<p>"Alright… but it ain’t a nice story.” He waited a couple of moments, maybe to see if I’d withdraw my request. “I learned ‘bout engines from Lyle, the carnival’s mechanic. He kept the rides ‘n generators runnin’. I’d tag along, watchin', learnin'. He had this old WWII surplus Harley-Davidson WLA flathead. God, I wanted to ride that thing. Never got the chance."</p>
<p>"Summer of ’53, I was thirteen. Carnival was set up at the Cody Stampede, down in Wyoming. Lyle heard the Tilt-A-Whirl was actin’ up." He paused. "You know what a Tilt-A-Whirl is?"</p>
<p>I nodded. "Yeah, the carnival at the county fair in Missoula had one. It was really old, made with a lot of wood, clattered a lot." Thinking back, I grimaced. "I didn't throw up... wanted to, though."</p>
<p>"Heh. Could be the very same one. Likely converted to electric by now. That engine—a Wisconsin V4, a tractor engine, no muffler— goddamn it was loud—couldn't talk anywhere 'round it."</p>
<p>He thought for a moment and continued. "It broke down—tow cable problem—Lyle sent me under it to look—said I was his eyes where he couldn't go. Said that whenever I helped him... He was a good man."</p>
<p>"Karl, do you remember that second day after we met? Caught you starin' at that old photo on my wall?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, you said you knew a guy in it."</p>
<p>"Uh huh. That was him. Clancy. He gave me this scar." He let out a loud breath as if that had been a tough thing to say.</p>
<p>"Was under the ride, way out in the middle—Lyle had walked away—Clancy loaded marks on it and started it runnin'. Support arm bowled me over, damn near scalped me, like the old West Indian stories." He stopped again for a moment. "That's what Sarah told me happened. I don't remember nothin' that day."</p>
<p>"Sarah? Your wife?" I flashed on Gladys mentioning Sarah being from the carnival.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0227" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah, me and Sarah—been tight since before I can remember. Her folks worked the ring toss and a couple other games in the midway. She pulled my ass outta the fire more times than I can count." He let out a dry laugh. "She’s the perfect wife for me. I love her. I just don’t fuck her—not that she'd ever want it."</p>
<p>"Woke up in the hospital in Cody. No idea how long—days, more than a week. Nobody came. Carnival moved on."</p>
<p>"Holy shit, they just left you?" I said louder than mean to—captivated by his story.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Hospital wanted payin'. I didn't have any money. Sheriff tried handin’ me off to the state work farm. I ran. Tried to catch up to the carnival. Chased ‘em—Billings, Bozeman, Butte. Missed ‘em every time. Butte’s as far as I got. I was so hungry."</p>
<p>I asked, "How did you even get that far?"</p>
<p>"Got from Cody to Billings in the back of a truck with some rodeo hands. Jumped a box car to Bozeman, then the same for Butte—old Northern Pacific. Met a priest, Father Daniel O'Shae, he saw me jump off the train in the Butte yard. He was givin’ food to the hobos by the tracks. Took him some work—like tryin’ to feed a stray dog that didn’t trust nobody. I kept runnin’, but he kept comin’ back. That winter, damn near froze to death. Sleepin’ in alleys, diggin’ through trash cans for scraps—"</p>
<p>"Vince, you were just a kid! How can they let that happen to you?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0234" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Hell, it was the fifties. The town was full of ‘em—out-of-luck miners, drunks, Indians, whole families living by the tracks in Butte. Churches—that's all there was it for help.” He let out a dry laugh. “Like you said a couple of months back—fish hooks. Churches always feed you fish hooks, nuns tried to trap me at a shelter. They’d sent me to an orphanage or a work farm. I kept running’. But Father Dan… he listened. Never tried to trap me. Gave me food. Warmer clothes. He’d talk to me, not all that Jesus crap."</p>
<p>"He got me hooked up with one of his parishioners—George Doyle. He owned Silver Bow Motors—first Harley shop in the state. He gave me my first job at fourteen. That’s where I learned to wrench bikes. I lived in the back of the shop till I was twenty-one."</p>
<p>"Wait a minute... The same George from the club?"</p>
<p>"Yup. The man I betrayed—he saved my life and gave me a place to live for more'n ten years—wouldn’t follow him into the fire."</p>
<p>"Holy shit. Vince, I'm so sorry."</p>
<p>"Just how life was." He cleared his throat and repositioned himself. "You had enough of this story yet?"</p>
<p>"How did you meet back up with Sarah?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0241" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Oh God, let's see… I was nineteen. I just built my first bike—welded the frame, put the engine together, the whole damn thing. Proud as hell. I loved riding it. I heard there was a carnival in Otis Park—that place is under the freeway now—and figured I’d check it out. Turned out it was Western Star."</p>
<p>"Bought a ticket, walked the midway.” Vince chuckled. “Sarah tried to run me off—I just stared at her. As soon as I opened my mouth, she knew. She leapt clean over the bally bar and hugged me like she’d never let go. Her ma grabbed one of the rousties to cover the game. Sarah and her folks sat with me in the back, talking for a couple of hours."</p>
<p>"They told me the story of that day. My ma told everyone I died in the hospital. She wore a black veil for a month, like it was true. That's why nobody came for me."</p>
<p>"My God, Vince. That's awful." I felt so foolish with my family drama—orders of magnitude less horrific. Tears welled up in my eyes.</p>
<p>"I wanted to find Lyle. I wanted to show him the bike I built. I wanted him to be proud of me. But I couldn’t. He thought it was his fault—thought he killed me. He... uh." Vince's voice faltered for a moment. "He put a bullet in his head at the next lot in Billings. Never knew my pa. Prob’ly just one of Ma’s johns. Lyle’s the closest I had back at the show."</p>
<p>I tried to hide my crying, but Vince figured it out. "It's okay, buddy." He tightened his hug around me and gently stroked my head. "It's okay, man. It was a long time ago.”</p>
<p>I choked out through my tears, "How could your mother do this to you? Holy fuck."</p>
<p>"Hey. I got through it. I got through all this shit.  I warned you wouldn't like this story."</p>
<p>“Was your mother still at the carnival?”</p>
<p>He hesitated, probably not wanting to stir me up any more. “I walked into her tent like any other mark. I paid my two bits for a tarot reading. She figured out who I was pretty damn quick.”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>I felt him draw a deep breath and let it out in a sigh.</p>
<p>“Ain’t gonna tell you what me and Ma said to each other—wasn’t no happy reunion. Never told Sarah or Chris, neither. Those words die with me. Never spoken again.”</p>
<p>“Ma only made it three more years. She died right there in her tent with a mark sitting at her table." He paused. "Sarah probably poisoned her.”</p>
<p>I startled.</p>
<p>“Just a joke, just a joke." He chuckled. "Poison's not Sarah's style.”</p>
<p>I sniffed a few times, forcing control—deep breaths—calm down. I marveled at Vince's strength. He went through all that, but came out the other side compassionate instead of angry.</p>
<p>“Karl, I do not mean any sort of disrespect with this. You’re a kid, too. Thrown out of your family—living alone in a cabin in the forest an Blackfeet land—middle of bumfuck nowhere—one of the harshest climates in the country.”</p>
<p>"I'm not starving or freezing like you did."</p>
<p>"I didn’t have to worry about grizzlies. And listen—don’t make sense to stack up our troubles like that. I got help. Father Dan first, then George. Now I’m paying it forward. You need help. I’m here."</p>
<p>I started to cry again, couldn't hold it back—but I struggled. Vince just held me. The disapproving faces kept coming—my parents, David—trying to worm their way around the protection of Vince's enclosing arms. I slipped into dreams and we both slept through the night on the floor.</p>
