            <h2 id="TheIronHorse">The Iron Horse</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pulled on my down jacket for the sixty second walk over to the Horse for my shift—eight until closing. I stepped out, pulling my door shut—goddamn, how far below zero tonight? Weaving between the potholes sealed with iron-hard plugs of ice, I kept to the gravel to the front door. Crowded lot—more pickup trucks than normal—spotted a lot of 4 plates—Foresters from Missoula, maybe.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pushed through the door into the warmth. The right side of my face felt the radiant heat of it as I smiled and nodded at Dolph. I pushed through the crowd toward the office. Lots of Forester patches—not all Missoula—bunch of Oregon guys—Springfield and Roseburg patches.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Bike clubs in the winter are weird—lots of patches, no bikes in the lot.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Two guys, Lugnut and Bull, stood sentry on either side of the hallway to the office, the cardroom and the Bastard's Club Room. I breezed by them and knocked on the office door.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris let me in with a welcoming grin.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We took that left door and I stepped into the Bastards Clubroom for the first time. With the huge wooden beams trussing the high ceiling, the fire in the stone fireplace, and the long central table, reminded me of a viking long house. I grinned with the wicked thought—with wall hangings that seemed choreographed, perfectly tuned colors, and lighting that drew focus—a gay man had to have designed this. I turned to Chris.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He grinned back at me, reading my mind. "Luke did it years ago. Gay design gene. You didn't notice the design down in his bar? That trough urinal?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I flashed back a memory of pissing on a chrome Buick logo and laughed. "Yeah that's brilliant, every guy gets to choose what brand to piss on."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“When Harley busted free from AMF a couple years ago, he must have cut a dozen AMF logos off basketballs for the trough.” We had a Bastards’ run down there just to piss on AMF.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Shaking my head, I thought back, but came up empty. “I don’t think I ever saw them.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Vince wanted have a trough here too, but Sarah vetoed it. She's the one with the practical smarts."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We hiked back to the rear of the room where two cardroom tables had been relocated. Makeshift hanging lights spotlighted each table. I put my hand out to see its sharp shadow on the felt. My brow furrowed at Chris.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He grimaced. "Yeah, that's not ideal, is it?" He looked around the room and then called out. "Hey Griz, we need some better lamps here at the table. You know where the pool table lights got stored? We need a couple of 'em. One over each table."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #945500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>From the far end of the room, "I'm on it!" Grizz disappeared through the doorway back to the bar.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris turned back to me. "We're gonna get this set up so when you need to get to the cashier, you'll be escorted from the table to the office. You can go in and out as you please when you don't have your toke box. Lonna will be here in an hour. She's staff, not club, so she needs escort both in and out. You'll both be dealing eight until two. You can have a couple breaks, I'm relief dealer. No need to swap out toke boxes. Usual signals."</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I realized that the Oregon Foresters were younger guys on a ski trip to Big Mountain in Whitefish.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He sat down at my table about an hour and a half into my shift. He looked familiar, suppose I met him last Summer when the whole club rode through—great beard. I loved the way it grew from way up on his cheeks—really familer. I pondered for a moment when it hit me—that bearded cop in the Cut Bank Court House.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Couldn't be him, this guy's Foresters patched.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We played through several hands as I watched him. Mediocre player—tried to bluff hands that he should have folded—then folded hands that could that I suspect could have won if played more astutely.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>At ten o'clock, I raise my hand as my break signal. I got through two more hands before Chris showed up to relieve me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I left the clubroom and entered the main bar. Whiskey spotted me and came over with my beer bottle already refilled with ginger ale. I stood at the bar for a few minutes before I spotted Dolph at the front door. I headed straight over.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Hey Dolph. Do you remember that bearded cop last month at the courthouse? You drew a picture of him for me."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He nodded.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I think he's in the Clubroom. The beard, the voice sounded right to me."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph frowned and pulled out his sketchpad, started thumbing back through the pages. He stopped and flipped the image to me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked carefully. "Yeah, that's him. I'm mean, it's weird to ID a guy by his beard, but look how it grows almost from way up his cheeks just under his eyes."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph snatched this pad back and pointed at me and then the stool at his station by door. He strode into the crowd.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I had a shocked moment that he left me as a makeshift bouncer, but Rooster had my back before I could blink. He stepped up beside me watching Dolph go. He turned and looked at me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shrugged and stayed put like he ordered.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Two or three minutes later, I spotted Dolph emergying from the hallway to the clubroom.  He stepped behind the bar then headed straight to Vince. I couldn't hear him from across the room, but they exchanged words.  Dolph pulled out his sketchbook. I saw Vince nod.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Hey, Nancy." Vince called out over the general din of the crowd. I saw her, one of waitresses, step up to the bar and stretch up to hear Vince. He bent over the bar and spoke a moment.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She nodded. She pushed through the crowd toward the bar's front wall, way down to the far end where the pool tables were last summer. Reaching up to the window and pulling the chain, she turned the Rainier Beer sign off.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Interesting," Rooster said to himself.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The bar's front door opened with a cold blast of air. My tanktop and Bastards cut did nothing to block it—shivering cold—not dressed for the door. Rooster stepped between me and those coming in, not to block the cold, but to take any implied roll of security from me—not a problem.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Three Bastards filed in, Stitch, Yogi, and Wrench. I had learned to really like club names—so much easier to remember than given names.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Once the door closed and I looked back to the bar, Dusty tended bar d where Vince had stood.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph pushed through the crowd back to me and Rooster. Addressing me, he said, “Back to your shift. Keep him at your table. Just watch."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I nodded and gratefully pushed into the warmer crowd toward Lugnut and Bull. The sound of the bar had changed. Looking about, a couldn't see that anything different, but just felt odd.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The Rainier sign was clearly a signal that all the Bastards got but I just didn't know anything about.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris handed the table back to me. I mucked Chris' deck and unsealed a new one. I did a quick set of showy shuffles and started the next hand.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dealing poker was like being the conductor of a band. While the cards may be random and the players unpredictable, I could set up rhythms in the speed of the play. With speed control, I can shift their emotions—build them up and let them down to breath.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>For the next twenty minutes I took my players on a ride through hills and valleys.</p>
