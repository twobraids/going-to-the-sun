            <h2 id="TheIronHorse">The Iron Horse</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pulled on my down jacket for the sixty second walk over to the Horse for my shift—eight until closing. I stepped out, pulling my door shut—goddamn, how far below zero tonight? Weaving between the potholes sealed with iron-hard plugs of ice, I kept to the gravel to the front door. Crowded lot—more pickup trucks than normal—spotted a lot of 4 plates—Foresters from Missoula, maybe.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pushed through the door into the warmth. The right side of my face felt the radiant heat of it as I smiled and nodded at Dolph. I pushed through the crowd toward the office. Lots of Forester patches—not all Missoula—bunch of Oregon guys—Springfield and Roseburg patches.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Bike clubs in the winter are weird—lots of patches, no bikes in the lot.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Two guys, Lugnut and Bull, stood sentry on either side of the hallway to the office, the cardroom and the Bastard's Club Room. I breezed by them and knocked on the office door.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris let me in with a welcoming grin.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We took that left door and I stepped into the Bastards Clubroom for the first time. With the huge wooden beams trussing the high ceiling, the fire in the stone fireplace, and the long central table, reminded me of a viking long house. I grinned with the wicked thought—with wall hangings that seemed choreographed, perfectly tuned colors, and lighting that drew focus—a gay man had to have designed this. I turned to Chris.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He grinned back at me, reading my mind. "Luke did it years ago. Gay design gene. You didn't notice the design down in his bar? That trough urinal?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I flashed back a memory of pissing on a chrome Buick logo and laughed. "Yeah that's brilliant, every guy gets to choose what brand to piss on."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“When Harley busted free from AMF a couple years ago, he must have cut a dozen AMF logos off basketballs for the trough.” We had a Bastards’ run down there just to piss on AMF.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Shaking my head, I thought back, but came up empty. “I don’t think I ever saw them.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Vince wanted have a trough here too, but Sarah vetoed it. She's the one with the practical smarts."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We hiked back to the rear of the room where two cardroom tables had been relocated. Makeshift hanging lights spotlighted each table. I put my hand out to see its sharp shadow on the felt. My brow furrowed at Chris.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He grimaced. "Yeah, that's not ideal, is it?" He looked around the room and then called out. "Hey Griz, we need some better lamps here at the table. You know where the pool table lights got stored? We need a couple of 'em. One over each table."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #b46d00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>From the far end of the room, "I'm on it!" Grizz disappeared through the doorway back to the bar.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris turned back to me. "We're gonna get this set up so when you need to get to the cashier, you'll be escorted from the table to the office. You can go in and out as you please when you don't have your toke box. Lonna will be here in an hour. She's staff, not club, so she needs escort both in and out. You'll both be dealing eight until two. You can have a couple breaks, I'm relief dealer. No need to swap out toke boxes. Usual signals."</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I realized that the Oregon Foresters were younger guys on a ski trip to Big Mountain in Whitefish.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He sat down at my table about an hour into my shift. He looked familiar, suppose I met him last Summer when the whole club rode through—great beard. I pondered that beard for a moment when it hit me—that bearded cop in the Cut Bank Court House.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Couldn't be him, this guy's Foresters patched.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Hey Dolph. Do you remember that bearded cop last month? The one you drew?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He nodded.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I think he's in the Clubroom. The beard, the voice sounded right to me."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph frowned and pulled out his sketchpad, started thumbing back through the pages. He stopped and flipped the image to me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked carefully. "Yeah, that's him. I'm mean, it's weird to ID a guy by his beard, but look how he shaves it off his cheeks."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph snatched this pad back and pointed at me and then his station by door. He strode past Lugnut and Bull and disappeared down the hallway.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Seems I'm suddenly a bouncer.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I watched Dolph return from hallway and he stepped behind the bar. Going straight to Vince.  They exchanged some words and Dolph showed him the sketchbook.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Hey, Nancy." Vince called out over the general din of the crowd. I saw one of waitresses step up to the bar. Vince gave her some instructions and she nodded.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I traced her pushing through the crowd toward the bar's front wall way down at the far end where the pool tables were last summer. She reached out and pulled the chain on the Rainier Beer sign. It went out.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I lost sight of her after that.  Vince had disappeared from the bar with Whiskey taking over.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph pushed through the crowd back to relieve me from the front door. “Finish your shift. He’s just a mark, but keep watchin’.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I nodded and I started back to the clubroom.</p>
