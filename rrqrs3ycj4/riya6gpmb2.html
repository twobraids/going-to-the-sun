            <h2 id="TheIronHorse">The Iron Horse</h2>
<p>I pulled on my down jacket for the sixty second walk over to the Horse for my shift—eight until closing. I stepped out, pulling my door shut—goddamn, how far below zero tonight? Weaving between the potholes sealed with iron-hard plugs of ice, I kept to the gravel to the front door. Crowded lot—more pickup trucks than normal—spotted a lot of 4 plates—Foresters from Missoula, maybe.</p>
<p>I pushed through the door into the warmth. The right side of my face felt the radiant heat of it as I smiled and nodded at Dolph. I pushed through the crowd toward the office. Lots of Forester patches—not all Missoula—bunch of Oregon guys—Springfield and Roseburg patches.</p>
<p>Bike clubs in the winter are weird—lots of patches, no bikes in the lot.</p>
<p>Two guys, Lugnut and Bull, stood sentry on either side of the hallway to the office, the cardroom and the Bastard's Club Room. I breezed by them and knocked on the office door.</p>
<p>Chris let me in with a welcoming grin.</p>
<hr>
<p>We took that left door and I stepped into the Bastards Clubroom for the first time. With the huge wooden beams trussing the high ceiling, the fire in the stone fireplace, and the long central table, reminded me of a viking long house. I grinned with the wicked thought—with wall hangings that seemed choreographed, perfectly tuned colors, and lighting that drew focus—a gay man had to have designed this. I turned to Chris.</p>
<p>He grinned back at me, reading my mind. "Luke did it years ago. Gay design gene. You didn't notice the design down in his bar? That trough urinal?"</p>
<p>I flashed back a memory of pissing on a chrome Buick logo and laughed. "Yeah that's brilliant, every guy gets to choose what brand to piss on."</p>
<p>“When Harley busted free from AMF a couple years ago, he must have cut a dozen AMF logos off basketballs for the trough.” We had a Bastards’ run down there just to piss on AMF.”</p>
<p>Shaking my head, I thought back, but came up empty. “I don’t think I ever saw them.”</p>
<p>"Vince wanted have a trough here too, but Sarah vetoed it. She's the one with the practical smarts."</p>
<p>We hiked back to the rear of the room where two cardroom tables had been relocated. Makeshift hanging lights spotlighted each table. I put my hand out to see its sharp shadow on the felt. My brow furrowed at Chris.</p>
<p>He grimaced. "Yeah, that's not ideal, is it?" He looked around the room and then called out. "Hey Griz, we need some better lamps here at the table. You know where the pool table lights got stored? We need a couple of 'em. One over each table."</p>
<p>From the far end of the room, "I'm on it!" Grizz disappeared through the doorway back to the bar.</p>
<p>Chris turned back to me. "We're gonna get this set up so when you need to get to the cashier, you'll be escorted from the table to the office. You can go in and out as you please when you don't have your toke box. Lonna will be here in an hour. She's staff, not club, so she needs escort both in and out. You'll both be dealing eight until two. You can have a couple breaks, I'm relief dealer. No need to swap out toke boxes. Usual signals."</p>
<hr>
<p>I realized that the Oregon Foresters were younger guys on a ski trip to Big Mountain in Whitefish.</p>
<hr>
<p>He sat down at my table about an hour and a half into my shift. He looked familiar, suppose I met him last Summer when the whole club rode through—great beard. I loved the way it grew from way up on his cheeks—really familiar. I pondered for a moment when it hit me—that bearded cop in the Cut Bank Court House.</p>
<p>Couldn't be him, this guy wore the Foresters cut.  The name stitched to his vest identified him as Deadhead. Figured it must be the band reference, but he didn't have a patch for the Dead's Stealie lightning skull.</p>
<p>We played through several hands as I watched him. Mediocre player—tried to bluff hands that he should have folded—then folded hands that could that I suspect could have won if played more astutely.</p>
<p>Some time after eleven, I raised my hand as my break signal. I got through two more hands before Chris showed up to relieve me.</p>
<p>I left the clubroom and entered the main bar. Whiskey spotted me and came over with my beer bottle already refilled with ginger ale. I stood at the bar for a few minutes before I spotted Dolph at the front door. I headed straight over.</p>
<p>"Hey Dolph. Do you remember that bearded cop last month at the courthouse? You drew a picture of him for me."</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>"I think he's in the Clubroom. The beard, the voice sounded right to me."</p>
<p>Dolph frowned and pulled out his sketchpad, started thumbing back through the pages. He stopped and flipped the image to me.</p>
<p>I looked carefully. "Yeah, that's him. I'm mean, it's weird to ID a guy by his beard, but look how it grows almost from way up his cheeks just under his eyes."</p>
<p>Dolph snatched this pad back and pointed at me and then the stool at his station by door. He strode into the crowd.</p>
<p>I had a shocked moment that he left me as a makeshift bouncer, but Rooster had my back before I could blink. He stepped up beside me watching Dolph go. He turned and looked at me.</p>
<p>I shrugged and stayed put like he silently ordered.</p>
<p>Two or three minutes later, I spotted Dolph emerging from the hallway to the clubroom.  He stepped behind the bar then headed straight to Vince. I couldn't hear him from across the room, but they exchanged words.  Dolph pulled out his sketchbook. I saw Vince nod.</p>
<p>"Hey, Nancy." Vince called out over the general din of the crowd. I saw her, one of waitresses, step up to the bar and stretch up to hear Vince. He bent over the bar and spoke a moment.</p>
<p>She nodded. She pushed through the crowd toward the bar's front wall, way down to the far end where the pool tables were last summer. Reaching up to the window and pulling the chain, she turned the Rainier Beer sign off.</p>
<p>"What did you tell him?" Rooster said to me as he looked down at me.</p>
<p>The bar's front door opened with a cold blast of air, saving me from having to answer.</p>
<p>My tank top and Bastards cut did nothing to block it—shivering cold—not dressed for the door. Rooster stepped between me and those coming in, not to block the cold, but to take any implied roll of security from me—not a problem.</p>
<p>Three Bastards filed in, Stitch, Yogi, and Wrench. By the way they looked around as they entered, they clearly knew something was up. Rooster held two fingers up to his mouth as if bumming a cigarette. All three of them declined. I didn't remember Rooster ever smoking. The trio just walked casually to the bar.</p>
<p>I watched their progress, and realized that Vince was gone, Dusty stood in his place.</p>
<p>Dolph pushed through the crowd back to me and Rooster. Addressing me, he said, “Back in. Keep him happy. Don’t let him walk."</p>
<p>I nodded and gratefully pushed into the warmer crowd toward Lugnut and Bull guarding the corridor. The sound of the bar had changed. Looking about, a couldn't see that anything different, but just felt odd.</p>
<p>The Rainier sign, bumming a cigarette—signals that nobody shared with me.</p>
<p>I strolled back to the clubroom, between the guards, and back toward my poker table.</p>
<p>Chris nodded at me, finished the active game, then handed the table back to me. I mucked Chris' deck and unsealed a new one. I did a quick set of showy shuffles and started the next hand.</p>
<p>The players had changed. Cherry now sat to the left of me with Slim to his left. The remaining three players were Foresters.</p>
<p>The middle guy's vest identified him as Coyote, the Forester's Sargent-at-Arms. He was older guy with a gray beard, built like a linebacker.   He had a brass-knuckle patch, like the one Dolph wore.</p>
<p>The middle Forester was Deadhead, the guy that I was supposed to keep in his seat.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The third Forester was a young guy, probably about my age. The road name "Dragsaw" stood out on his vest. I didn't know what a dragsaw was.</p>
<p>Dealing poker was like being a band conductor. Everybody follows the tempo that I set. Fast game with no time to think, or slow game where the weaker players get precious time to think.  To keep my mark at the table, I wanted him to keep him winning. When I saw him with a promising hand, I ensured he had time to think about it. I didn't give him time to think about the weak hands, a sure way to get him folded  early.</p>
<p>The next hand started slow, but I picked up the pace as I saw his position weaken.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0052" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After a couple hands, I flashed on Chris striding into the clubroom on a mission. I had to keep my eyes on the felt, but I knew he'd eventually show up at my table. I glanced again as he passed Lonna's table.  Chris stepped between Silm and Coyote. He bent over to Coyote's ear, just as he pushed out and announced his bet.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #844900;">&#x25CF;</span></b>His brow furrowed as he turned to face Chris. "I'm in the middle of a hand here."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0054" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris shook no, hard. "Gotta be now." He met eyes with me, "Rack him. Write a payout slip."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I jumped to it immediately. I raked his chips, stacked them, counted them. I pulled the pad up from under the table. Filled it in, signed it and handed it across the table. Chris snagged it from me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0056" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Goddamn it." Got up like his hips hurt. He walked away from his cards, following Chris out of the Club Room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0057" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>With him barely two paces away, I took control of my table. Deadhead and Dragsaw had both turned away from their cards watching Coyote leave. "Gentlemen, the strong hand has folded. We continue with four players at fifth street."</p>
<p>Dragsaw leaned in to comment to Deadhead, "That was weird."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0059" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>While I listened to the two Foresters, both Cherry and Slim had their eyes on me. On a hunch, I raised two fingers to my mustache as if I held a cigarette between them, just for a moment.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0060" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Cherry's eyes widened. Slim subtly nodded.</p>
<p>Deadhead chuckled looking at Dragsaw, not the table. "Bet Kindling puked on somebody important."</p>
<p>I stood there looking at Deadhead. He looked around the table confused by the silence.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0063" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I nudged him. "Your bet, sir?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0064" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He held the high hand and didn't even know it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0065" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He placed his bet—incorrectly—should have checked. Hard to help a player from the box, but I suspect he ended up mucking the high hand.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0066" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We got through only four more games before I caught Chris coming back in. He gave a quick across the throat gesture and then pointed down with his right hand—shutdown the table and cash everyone out.</p>
<p>I glanced over to Lonna, just as she looked at me as if I would know what was going on. I shrugged at her.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0068" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We both wrapped up the active hand and announced the shut down and cash out.</p>
<p>A couple minutes later, Vince walked into the room with a mission. He didn't yell, but his voice carried loud enough to silence everyone. "Alright you filthy bastards, when that clock hits midnight, every one of you, Bastard or Forester, gets a free shot of the best goddamn whiskey we got. None o’ that well shit. I’m talkin’ top shelf, poured heavy. You got ten minutes. Ever'one inta the bar. We're clearin' the clubroom!"</p>
<p>I didn't rush the payout. Nobody told me to stop delaying the mark from leaving my table. I raked Cherry and Slim out first, then let the two Foresters hang for a minute.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0071" style="color: #753e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Hey, Slim, I'm gonna be here for a while closing out. Tell Whiskey to make one of his specials for me."</p>
<p>"Specials?" Slim turned back to me.</p>
<p>"Whiskey'll know what you mean."</p>
<p>He nodded, but looked a little confused.</p>
<p>I raked Dragsaw's chips, slow counted them out, racked them, then wrote out his slip.</p>
<p>I raked in Deadhead's chips. "So your road name from the band?" Hoped to hold him a minute longer with conversation.</p>
<p>"Nah, I drive logs for the Idamont Mill. When they bought out Polleys Lumber, I had to deadhead a dozen trucks from their Grangeville mill."</p>
<p>I nodded as I spotted a couple of Dolph's guys, Rooster and Bull, converging on my table from two sides. By time they arrived, I handed Deadhead his payout slip.</p>
<p>Deadhead, looked at each of the guys approaching, then walked to briskly to the door. They followed him, the last Forester out of the Clubroom.</p>
<p>By the time Lonna and I got our tokens and cash boxes checked in and balanced, we got to the bar about a minute until midnight.  As we stepped up to the bar, Whiskey handed a shot to Lonna. He turned and plucked a pre-poured shot from the shelf, turned and set it on the bar. As I reached for it, he placed his hand over it, and then gestured, index finger up, to wait. I stopped and looked up and he gave me the two finger cigarette motion.</p>
<p>Standing at the far end of the bar from me, Vince started shouting out a countdown. By the time he got to six, just about everyone had joined in.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0082" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>At the midnight mark, volleys of gunshots sounded out in front of the bar—felt the air concussion even through the brick walls.</p>
<p>Lonna shrieked and we both dropped to the floor along with almost all the Foresters. The Bastards obviously expected it and stood firm.</p>
<p>The volley ended with one loud blast from a double barreled shot gun.</p>
<p>Vince's voice boomed out over the bar, "Raise your glass to our guests, the Foresters from Missoula and their very own special guest, Agent John 'Deadhead' Anderson from the US Drug Enforcement Administration."</p>
<p>He and the Bastards raised their glasses and downed them. Lonna and I stood up, looking around wide eyed. While the Bastards knew what was to happen, the non-club staff had not.</p>
<p>Vince continued, "I also want to thank Agent Anderson for donating that warm winter coat to our local men's shelter.  Now I'm sure that Coyote will agree, it time for the Foresters to leave to take care of their little problem somewhere off Bastard property."</p>
