            <h2 id="TheIronHorse">The Iron Horse</h2>
<p>I stood in the office with Judy, cashing out at the end of my shift. Pretty routine—tips too low—just matter of setting expectations with the card room filled with workers from the aluminum plant. The lumber mill workers tip better. The two groups rarely show up on the same night. Bars have rhythms.</p>
<p>With cash in hand, I turned to leave and found Dolph and Rooster standing at the door blocking my exit. I stepped toward them expecting they'd part and let me leave. Didn't happen, my boot squeaked on the floor as I stopped.</p>
<p>"Carnie wants to see you," Dolph said.</p>
<p>Looking at each in turn, I shrugged. "Sure. What's up?" Didn't get an answer.</p>
<p>The led me directly across the hall where Chris had taken me to the little apartment to fuck. One fluorescent tube the corridor's lights flickered randomly, like a weak strobe. The apartment door sat open.</p>
<p>Dolph walked right in and Rooster herded me in ahead of him. Carnie sat a the table with a pitcher of beer and a what looked like a cigar box.  Dolph sat down, reaching for the box. Carnie gestured for me to sit. Once my chair, Rooster sat down, too.</p>
<p>I looked around the table as they settled in with cigars. "Uh, what's up?"</p>
<p>"I just wanted the three of us to spend some time talking with ya. I've gotten to know ya pretty good, but these guys haven't had the opportunity. Time to change that.” He shoved the box over to me. “Have a cigar.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I hesitated, then selected one from the box. I sniffed it and flew back to my childhood—with my parents out to dinner—the fancy dark steakhouse with the dance floor—name and smell of the place came back—the Frontier Lounge. My mother's complaints  about cigar smoke surfaced in my recollection—she taught me to think only bad men smoked cigars—at their table now.</p>
<p>“Um. I don’t know how.” I held the thing in my fingers, turning it end for end, perplexed—not sure which end mattered.</p>
<p>"Not like smoking a joint. Don’t pull it deep." Dolph puffed his, a red glare from the tip, a pause and a cloud appeared around his face.</p>
<p>Hadn’t paid attention to how they lit theirs. I flipped it around again, "what end do you light?"</p>
<p>"Cut the sealed end." Dolph offered his knife from across the table.</p>
<p>"Just bite it off." Rooster insisted.</p>
<p>The small blade of my own Swiss Army knife, the sharper one, easily sliced the pointy tip. Rooster pushed the box of wooden matches to me—same brand that I used to light my cabin's wood stove.</p>
<p>I held the cigar in front of me with the flame, but it didn't seem to want to burn. The match got too short quickly.</p>
<p>After a second match, I got a smolder, so I tentatively put it up to my mouth, sealed my lips around it, and breathed in to stoke the burn.</p>
<p>“Nope…” Dolph barely had the word out before my first eruptive cough.</p>
<p>Rooster and Carnie laughed, but occupied with trying to cough my throat onto the floor, I couldn’t glare at them.</p>
<p>When I finally settled down, Carnie counseled me. "Ya just puff on it. Don’t use your lungs. Just your mouth. Watch me."</p>
<p>He demonstrated in an exaggerated way. I leaned in to look more closely. I tried what I thought was the technique. Didn’t do it very well, started coughing, but, with will power, suppressed it down after a moment.</p>
<p>I visualized kissing the head of Carnie’s dick. Exaggerated it like he did and I got a mouthful of smoke—not a sweet flavor like pot—richer, darker, leathery.</p>
<p>"That’s right. Just take in the in flavor and let it out." Carnie prompted me.</p>
<p>I started to snicker and it rapidly turned into a laugh. "Look how you hold it, put your lips on it. You're all practicing dick sucking."</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ!" Rooster banged on the table with his fist. "Why do all of you get such a kick about putting that image into my head?"</p>
<p>I felt myself blanche—cut off my laugh. Carnie and Dolph started laughing.</p>
<p>“Two Braids, you’re right. An excellent way to explain it.” Carnie said through his laughter.</p>
<p>"I'm decking the next guy that does it."</p>
<p>I stiffened up—</p>
<hr>
<p>Carnie smiled at Rooster. "Ask him about Molly’s Nipple."</p>
<p>"Molly’s Nipple?" Rooster looked very confused, glanced at me, then back to Carnie. "...one of Sarah's?"</p>
<p>"Jesus Roost', ask him." Carnie pointed his muscled arm at me.</p>
<p>Rooster looked back to me—frowning, irritated.</p>
<p>"It's gravel. Stretches from US89 to MT358. Starts out arrow straight, but then just rolls over into gully. Curve banked all wrong—it's a rush. The next curve is as perfect as it could be. Goes on for miles, not a moment of riding upright. Every fifth curve is wrong as that first one. Several spots of deep gravel..."</p>
<p>Carnie grinned like he'd just won the pot. Rooster just looked at him with his jaw half open, begging for an explanation.</p>
<p>I looked back and forth between them, my voice slowing. "It's easy to turn around at the hog farm. Makes it easy to run back through the other way."</p>
<p>"This is why I put him on Acid's bike." Carnie said as if were a logical conclusion.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I hear ya." Rooster nodded at Carnie. Looking back at me, he asked, "You're some kind of accountant?"</p>
<p>"No, not at all. Programmer." Figured I'd have to take this as simple as I could. "Computers are machines that can follow instructions. I'm good at writing instructions. I make programmed machines that people like Sarah and Chris, uh, Snake, can use to run businesses."</p>
<p>Rooster nodded—he didn't get a word of it.</p>
<p>"Go on." Carnie rolled his hand at me, prompting me to continue. "Tell him why you like it."</p>
<p>I looked warily at him and then my eyes fell on Dolph, madly working on his notepad. Not writing—sketching maybe? My thoughts snagged for a second on him.</p>
<p>"It's just another type of riding really. You know, on the bike, sometimes the road, the landscape, the engine, the weather, all synchronize perfectly. You're an animal focused on staying alive for the next few seconds, reaching for the next few after that. Best feeling ever. I can tap into that same ecstasy with just my mind while programming."</p>
<p>"Rooster," Carnie leaned forward on the table. "He's like Acid, but with a brain."</p>
<p>I got mad. "Hey, why do you guys keep throwing this guy, Acid, in my face all the time? You've made him into some sort of ghost haunting me because I'm riding his bike. It's already weird enough." I fell silent for a moment then declared, "I am not Acid."</p>
<p>Carnie laughed. "No, you are definitely not Acid.”</p>
<p>Rooster sat back and smirked at me. “From what a hear about you, you’ve probably never tripped.”</p>
<p>I drew back—Acid didn’t mean battery acid—nothing to do with bikes. “Too many assumptions, guys. LSD is a hell of a good time. Done it four or five times.”</p>
<p>“Four, five times, eh? Acid woulda called that a good week.” Carnie gave one hard head shake. “Trippin’ the day airbrushed the tank of the Ironhead. Glad the guy had artwork and bikes in his life.  About all he had going for him. Couldn’t make the right call to save his ass."</p>
<p>Rooster spoke up, "You still visit him down in Deer Lodge?"</p>
<p>"Nah, don't ya remember? He wrote that letter telling' me to stay away until I accepted Jesus. Guess they got preachers in the lockup. Acid’s an easy mark for ‘em."</p>
<p>"The thing I remember most about Acid was his riding. Jesus, he could handle that bike." Dolph grunted agreement from behind his cigar smoke. "Remember that time he got tired of formation and just peeled off?" Rooster broke out laughing.</p>
<p>Dolph, always so quiet, spoke up. "Expected George to whip him."</p>
<p>"Acid got away with a lot of shit." Carnie turned to me. "Acid was the son of the Bitterroot MC's President, Dwight Kronen, back in the day before the merge. Dwight died in '65 right after Acid patched in."</p>
<hr>
<p>"I don't know what to make of you." Rooster frowned at me with furrowed brow. "You don't fuckin' drink. Scrawny as shit."</p>
<p>"You said that about Snake Eyes twenty years back." Carnie looked smug. "He’s stacked more cash for the Club than all the rest of us put together."</p>
<p>Rooster response came quick. "Yeah, yeah. But Snake Eyes can strip a bike to the frame and then ride it by sundown."</p>
<p>Carnie locked eyes with Rooster. "Snake’ll apprentice him. Club ain’t just muscle. We need brains, too."</p>
<p>"Wait a minute," I interrupted. "What does me stripping a bike have to do with anything?"</p>
<p>Carnie looked straight at me, cigar smoldering in his fingers. "Karl, it's a motorcycle club. There's more to it than riding. If these guy agree, I'm starting you as prospect today. Can't be a brother until you’ll own your own bike, that'll come. You’ll wrench it yourself. That’s how it is. Snake'll teach you. It's a way simpler machine than what you do."</p>
<p>"Dirtier. Noisier."  Dolph nodded at me.</p>
<p>"Ok, I'm in." Rooster looked hard at me. "You got a lot to learn. Any respect you get will have to be earned."</p>
<p>He focused back on Carnie. "What you gonna do when one of Dolph's guys decides to rough him up? Test him."</p>
<p>Dolph put his hand on the table hard. "Nope. Not happenin'. Already made it clear."</p>
<p>Rooster looked skeptical. "You watchin' that prospect, Grizz? He's your wildcard."</p>
<p>Dolph nodded. "I know. Bull 'n him had a standoff yesterday. Bull settled it right."</p>
<p>I just watched them talk about my safety—feeling like I needed to pull away from the table—intimidated. I sucked on my cigar wrong, exploded into coughing again.</p>
<p>They all turned to look at me. Rooster shook his head.</p>
<p>Humiliating.</p>
<p>"Two Braids is a special case here. Officially, he's under Snake, but Sarah's got a claim on him, too."</p>
<p>Am I just livestock?</p>
<p>Rooster laughed. "Pity the guy that pisses her off."</p>
<p>Carnie responded instantly. "Makes him my responsibility. He's mine. Anyone..." He paused for a moment, like he looked for the right word. "damages him, there'll be hell to pay."</p>
<p>Rooster, looked around. "Where is Snake, anyway? Though he was gonna be here."</p>
<p>I spoke up. "He took the last table in the cardroom. Lonna went home sick a couple hours ago."</p>
<p>They all nodded.</p>
<p>Carnie stood up, walked over to a cabinet and pulled out a worn stained denim vest with a prospect cut embroidered on the back. He set it on the table in front of me.</p>
<p>"Snake was supposed to give this to you. It was his prospect patch back in the day."</p>
