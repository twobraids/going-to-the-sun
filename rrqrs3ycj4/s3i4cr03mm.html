<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stood in the office with Judy, cashing out at the end of my shift. Pretty routine—tips too low—just matter of setting expectations with the card room filled with workers from the aluminum plant. The lumber mill workers tip better. The two groups rarely show up on the same night. Bars have rhythms.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>With cash in hand, I turned to leave and found Dolph and Rooster standing at the door blocking my exit. I stepped toward them expecting they'd part and let me leave. Didn't happen, my boot squeaked on the floor as I stopped.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Vince wants to see you," Dolph said.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Looking at each in turn, I shrugged. "Sure. What's up?" Didn't get an answer.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The led me directly across the hall where Chris had taken me to the little apartment to fuck. One fluorescent tube the corridor's lights flickered randomly like a weak strobe light. The apartment door sat open.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph walked right in and Rooster herded me in ahead of him. Vince sat a the table with a pitcher of beer and a what looked like a cigar box.  Dolph sat down, reaching for the box. Vince gestured for me to sit. Once my chair, Rooster sat down, too.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked around the table. "Uh, what's up?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I just wanted the three of us to spend some time talking with ya. I've gotten to know ya pretty good, but these guys haven't had the opportunity. Time to change that."</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Over the next half hour, I had an interview. Vince asking me questions about my past, how I got to the Rez, card dealing, and computer programming. Dolph and Rooster didn't really say much.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince smiled at Rooster. "Ask him about Mollies Nipple."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Mollies Nipple?" Rooster looked very confused, glanced at me, then back to Vince. "...one of Sarah's?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Jesus Roost', ask him." Vince pointed his muscled arm at me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rooster looked back to me—frowning, irritated.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"It's gravel. Stretches from US89 to MT358. Starts out arrow straight, but then just rolls over into gully. Curve banked all wrong—it's a rush. The next curve is as perfect as it could be. Goes on for miles, not a moment of riding upright. Every fifth curve is wrong as that first one. Several spots of deep gravel..."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince grinned like he'd just won the pot. Rooster just looked at him with his jaw half open, begging for an explanation.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked back and forth between them, my voice slowing. "It's easy to turn around at the hog farm. Makes it easy to run back through the other way."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"This is why I put him on Ed's bike." Vince said as if were a logical conclusion.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah, I hear ya." Rooster nodded at Vince. Looking back at me, he asked, "You're some kind of accountant?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No, not at all. Programmer." Figured I'd have to take this as simple as I could. "Computers are machines that can follow instructions. I'm good at writing instructions. I make programmed machines that people like Sarah and Chris can use to run businesses."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rooster nodded—he didn't get a word of it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Go on. Tell him why you like it." Vince prompted me with his hands.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked warily at him and then my eyes fell on Dolph, madly working on his notepad. Not writing—sketching maybe? My thoughts snagged for a second on him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"It's just another type of riding really. You know, on the bike, sometimes the road, the landscape, the engine, the weather, all synchronize perfectly. You're an animal focused on staying alive for the next few seconds, reaching for the next few after that. Best feeling ever. I can tap into that same ecstasy with just my mind while programming."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Rooster," Vince leaned forward on the table. "He's like Ed, but with a brain."</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I don't know what to make of you." Rooster frowned at me with furrowed brow. "You don't fuckin' drink. Scrawny as shit."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You said that about Snake Eyes twenty years back." Vince looked smug. "He’s stacked more cash for the Club than all the rest of us put together."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rooster response came quick. "Yeah, yeah. But Snake Eyes can strip a bike to the frame and then ride it by sundown."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince locked eyes with Rooster. "Chris’ll apprentice him. Club ain’t just muscle. We need brains, too."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Wait a minute," I interrupted. "What does me stripping a bike have to do with anything?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince looked straight at me, cigar smoldering in his fingers. "Karl, you pledge the Club today. When it’s time for the patch, you’ll own your own bike. You’ll wrench it yourself. That’s how it is. Chris'll train ya up."</p>
