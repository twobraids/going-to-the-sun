<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stood in the office with Judy, cashing out at the end of my shift. Pretty routine—tips too low—just matter of setting expectations with the card room filled with workers from the aluminum plant. The lumber mill workers tip better. The two groups rarely show up on the same night. Bars have rhythms.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>With cash in hand, I turned to leave and found Dolph and Rooster standing at the door blocking my exit. I stepped toward them expecting they'd part and let me leave. Didn't happen, my boot squeaked on the floor as I stopped.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Vince wants to see you," Dolph said.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Looking at each in turn, I shrugged. "Sure. What's up?" Didn't get an answer.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The led me directly across the hall where Chris had taken me to the little apartment to fuck. One fluorescent tube the corridor's lights flickered randomly, like a weak strobe. The apartment door sat open.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph walked right in and Rooster herded me in ahead of him. Vince sat a the table with a pitcher of beer and a what looked like a cigar box.  Dolph sat down, reaching for the box. Vince gestured for me to sit. Once my chair, Rooster sat down, too.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked around the table as they settled in with cigars. "Uh, what's up?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I just wanted the three of us to spend some time talking with ya. I've gotten to know ya pretty good, but these guys haven't had the opportunity. Time to change that.” He shoved the box over to me. “Have a cigar.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I hesitated, then selected one from the box. I sniffed it and flew suddenly back to my childhood—with my parents out to dinner—the fancy dark steakhouse with the dance floor—name and smell of the place came back—the Frontier Lounge. My mother's complaints  about cigar smoke surfaced in my recollection—she taught me to think only bad men smoked cigars—at their table now.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Um. I don’t know how.” I held the thing in my fingers, turning it end for end, perplexed—not sure which end mattered.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Not like smoking a joint. Don’t pull it deep." Dolph puffed his, a red glare from the tip, a pause and a cloud appeared around his face.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Hadn’t paid attention to how they lit theirs. I flipped it around again, "what end do you light?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Cut the sealed end." Dolph offered his knife from across the table.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Just bite it off." Rooster insisted.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The small blade of my own Swiss Army knife, the sharper one, easily sliced the pointy tip. Rooster pushed the box of wooden matches to me—same brand that I use to light my cabin's wood stove.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I held the cigar in front of me with the flame, but it didn't seem to want to burn. The match got too short quickly.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After a second match, I got a smolder, so I tentatively put it up to my mouth, sealed my lips around it, and breathed in to stoke the burn.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Nope…” Dolph barely had the word out before my first eruptive cough.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rooster and Vince laughed, but occupied with trying to cough my throat onto the floor, I couldn’t glare at them.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When I finally settled down, Vince counseled me. "Ya just puff on it. Don’t use your lungs. Just your mouth. Watch me."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He demonstrated in an exaggerated way. I leaned in to look more closely. I tried what I thought was the technique. Didn’t do it very well, started coughing, but, with will power, suppressed it down after a moment.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I visualized kissing the head of Vince’s dick. Exaggerated it like he did and I got a mouthful of smoke—not a sweet flavor like pot—richer, darker, leathery.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"That’s right. Just take in the in flavor and let it out." Vince prompted me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I started to snicker and it rapidly turned into a laugh. "Look how you hold it. Like you're practicing to suck dick."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Holy fuck!" Rooster banged on the table with his fist. "Why’d you have to put that image into my head?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Both Vince and Dolph joined me laughing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“You’re right. Good way to explain it.” Vince said through his laughter.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince smiled at Rooster. "Ask him about Molly’s Nipple."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Molly’s Nipple?" Rooster looked very confused, glanced at me, then back to Vince. "...one of Sarah's?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Jesus Roost', ask him." Vince pointed his muscled arm at me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rooster looked back to me—frowning, irritated.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"It's gravel. Stretches from US89 to MT358. Starts out arrow straight, but then just rolls over into gully. Curve banked all wrong—it's a rush. The next curve is as perfect as it could be. Goes on for miles, not a moment of riding upright. Every fifth curve is wrong as that first one. Several spots of deep gravel..."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince grinned like he'd just won the pot. Rooster just looked at him with his jaw half open, begging for an explanation.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked back and forth between them, my voice slowing. "It's easy to turn around at the hog farm. Makes it easy to run back through the other way."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"This is why I put him on Ed's bike." Vince said as if were a logical conclusion.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah, I hear ya." Rooster nodded at Vince. Looking back at me, he asked, "You're some kind of accountant?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No, not at all. Programmer." Figured I'd have to take this as simple as I could. "Computers are machines that can follow instructions. I'm good at writing instructions. I make programmed machines that people like Sarah and Chris can use to run businesses."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rooster nodded—he didn't get a word of it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Go on. Tell him why you like it." Vince prompted me with his hands.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked warily at him and then my eyes fell on Dolph, madly working on his notepad. Not writing—sketching maybe? My thoughts snagged for a second on him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"It's just another type of riding really. You know, on the bike, sometimes the road, the landscape, the engine, the weather, all synchronize perfectly. You're an animal focused on staying alive for the next few seconds, reaching for the next few after that. Best feeling ever. I can tap into that same ecstasy with just my mind while programming."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Rooster," Vince leaned forward on the table. "He's like Ed, but with a brain."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I got mad. "Hey, why do you guys keep throwing this guy, Ed, in my face all the time? You've made him into some sort of ghost haunting me because I'm riding his bike. It's already weird enough." I fell silent for a moment then declared, "I am not Ed."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince laughed. "No, you are not Ed. Glad the guy had artwork in his life and motorcycles, 'cause that's about all he had going for him. A fuck-up that never made the right decision. He'd believe anything you told him."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rooster spoke up, "You still visit him down in Deer Lodge?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Nah, don't ya remember? He wrote that letter telling' me to stay away until I accepted Jesus as my savior. Ed will always be a sucker."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0048" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince turned to me. "When we was kids on the midway, me ’n Sarah ran ’round, taggin’ rubes like him."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"The thing I remember most about Ed was his riding. Jesus, he could handle that bike." Rooster looked a bit wistful. "Remember that time he got tired of formation and just peeled off." Rooster broke out laughing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0050" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph joined the conversation. "Expected George would whip him."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0051" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Ed got away with a lot of shit." Vince turned to me. "Ed was the son of the Bitterroot MC's President, Dwight Kronen, back in the day before the merge. Dwight died in '65 right after Ed patched in."</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I don't know what to make of you." Rooster frowned at me with furrowed brow. "You don't fuckin' drink. Scrawny as shit."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0054" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You said that about Snake Eyes twenty years back." Vince looked smug. "He’s stacked more cash for the Club than all the rest of us put together."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rooster response came quick. "Yeah, yeah. But Snake Eyes can strip a bike to the frame and then ride it by sundown."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0056" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince locked eyes with Rooster. "Chris’ll apprentice him. Club ain’t just muscle. We need brains, too."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0057" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Wait a minute," I interrupted. "What does me stripping a bike have to do with anything?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince looked straight at me, cigar smoldering in his fingers. "Karl, it's a motorcycle club. There's more to it than riding. If these guy agree, I'm starting you as prospect today. Can't be a brother until you’ll own your own bike, that'll come. You’ll wrench it yourself. That’s how it is. Chris'll teach you. It's a way simpler machine than what you do."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0059" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Dirtier. Noisier."  Dolph nodded at me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0060" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Ok, I'm in." Rooster looked hard at me. "You got a lot to learn. Any respect you get will have to be earned."</p>
