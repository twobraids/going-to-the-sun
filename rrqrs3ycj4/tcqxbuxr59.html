            <h2 id="TheBadger-TwoMedicineWilderness">The Badger-Two Medicine Wilderness</h2>
<p>During the Summers, I had no work because school was out, I would don my backpack and wander into the Badger-Two Medicine wilderness. I always sought the view from the next ridge and cherishing my solitude. While I thought about David frequently, I did not, as I feared I would, fall in love with him. We were good buddies with benefits. I longed for the a time when I would have an actual lover, to have the mutual physical intimacy and company everyday. I seriously doubted it would ever happen. I knew in my heart that my fate squarely aimed me at perpetual solitude. So I decided to make the best of it and focus on doing whatever pleased me.</p>
<p>One of my favorite single day hikes was Buffalo Lakes. As the crow flies, they were only only a mile and a half away from my cabin. However, I'm generally unwilling to trespass on (non-corporate) private land.</p>
<p>The Badger Medicine was not a true capital "W" wilderness. Undeveloped roadless land, but unprotected by anything but its status as sacred to the people of the Blackfoot Nation.</p>
<p>Administered by the BLM, this land fell square into the sights of the early Reagan administration's zeal to give the government land away to log, drill, strip mine everywhere they could. James Watt, Regans EPA Administrated allegedly said, "My responsibility is to follow the Scriptures which call upon us to occupy the land until Jesus returns. God gave us these things to use. After the last tree is felled, Christ will come back." Exploration rights for oil and gas drilling sold for a mere one dollar per acre. Huge multinationals, vultures over a carcass, elbowed their way to plunder the land.</p>
<p>The BLM did not take the time to notify the Blackfeet Tribe or the National Park Service, the two largest neighbors of the Badger-Two Medicine. They even skipped environmental impact statement required by Federal Law. Needless to say, a controversy erupted as many organizations took umbrage starting protests and lawsuits. Their actions didn't bother the Feds, though, they opened the gates to let the companies in to start exploring and road building.</p>
<p>This was literally my backyard. A ten minute walk from my cabin and I was on that very BLM land. I had explored this place since I came to this area two years ago.</p>
<p>One of my favorite hikes from my cabin involved traversing some soggy wetlands the domains of a significant beaver population. Following the...</p>
