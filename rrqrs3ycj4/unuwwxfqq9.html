            </div>
                  
            <p>Not very often we got this kind of snow here on the east side of the mountains. No wind, heavy wet stuff, a constant sifting of huge flakes from the low clouds—like driving through a snow globe.</p>
<p>I popped the Subaru into four wheel drive and half mounted the snowbank in front of the Horned Owl Motel, getting off the highway shoulder. I pushed through the snow to the front door.</p>
<p>Rose opened the door just as I approached. I passed the "Closed for Winter" sign next to the entry.</p>
<p>My first impression of her was happiness. Like she radiated it. Quite a bit shorter than me with the high wide cheeks common of her people: a Blackfeet woman. She wore two long dark braids streaked with gray.</p>
<p>She ushered me into the mud room just beside the front desk to shed my boots. She gave me guest slippers, plush soft leather moccasins, to use indoors.</p>
<p>Once inside the heated space, I marveled at Tom's carpentry. Twenty years earlier, he had taken an abandoned square log house and a flock of tiny log cabins and built an eclectic motel on the main tourist street. The carved filigree, log walls, and native furnishings, earned "charming" in Sunset Magazine a few years back—now a town icon.</p>
<p>I suspected he had made all the furniture, too.</p>
<p>Of course I knew him, I'd seen him frequently around town. His motel was across the alley from where I worked as a programmer for Bill last year. The day Bill fired me, I met Tom for the first time sitting on a bench behind his motel smoking a joint. As I stormed out of Bill's place, Tom offered me a hit.  I knew he and Bill were tight. The encounter felt staged.</p>
<p>Just like today felt staged.</p>
<p>My first gig for Sarah away from the Iron Horse, landed me in a town on the Rez, for someone that I'd already met. No wonder she didn't send one of Dolph's guys with me.</p>
<p>Rose made a oddly formal introduction to Tom. He stood, looking awkward and self conscious, a tall lanky man in his fifties, bushy gray beard, his hair pulled back into a braid.</p>
<p>I hesitated in what I planned on saying, as Tom did not acknowledge knowing me at all—how could he not recognize me?</p>
<p>I followed his lead. We shook hands. I nearly fucked it up because it was a normal shake, not the biker wrist grip. He gave me a brief "howdy."</p>
<p>Rose gestured me to the left most of the chairs in front of the fire. They retired into their own two chairs.</p>
<p>Our conversation felt like an interview. Tom wanted to know about my political views. We generally stood on the same side but I braced for the Sovereign Citizen line. Thankfully, it didn't come.</p>
<p>"So you drive all the way from Kalispell?" He really went for the direct eye contact, like he was watching for my eyes to dilate in a lie.</p>
<p>I hesitated. "Well, no. I live at Railroad Creek. Gladys's place."</p>
<p>He started. "You're local?" Excitement clear in his voice, "That's just ten minutes away. How long you been here?"</p>
<p>"Uh." I paused again. "I'm just startin' my third year here."  I had seen him in the grocery store. I'd seen him at the Post Office.</p>
<p>Tom sighed, went silent, and broke the eye contact. His gaze drifted to the fire.</p>
<p>Rose leapt into the gap while putting her hand on Tom's forearm. "Oh, that makes sense. So many tourists and workers here for the just the summer. Hard to keep track of everybody."</p>
<p>Rose smiled at me. "How's Gladys doing?"</p>
<p>She just deftly rescued him from something—seemed really weird.</p>
<p>"Gladys is back at her sister's in Great Falls. Her brother-in-law isn't doing very well. She said she'll be back next week. She's gave me the job of keeping pipes from freezing in the restaurant and her trailer house.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's nice of you." She beamed at me.</p>
<p>"Railroad Creek Ranch, you're right up against the Badger-Two Med'. You know about Fina Oil?" Tom renewed the intensity of his eye contact with me.</p>
<p>"That one of the drilling companies?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, They’re gonna to try pushin' a road through from False Summit to the upper South Fork of the Two Medicine." Tom voice raised an octave as he got excited.</p>
<p>Rose got up from her chair and headed to the kitchen. Just before she vanished through the doorway, our eyes met and she smiled.</p>
<p>Tom ranted about the BLM granting leases on land sacred to the tribe. "The courts aren't helping, they're too slow. They gotta be stopped."</p>
<p>I smiled at him. "Tom, I've been pulling survey stakes since last spring." My confession sparked a jolt of I-shouldn't-have-said-that.</p>
<p>That silenced him for a moment.  He lean toward me. "Good on you, man." He nodded looking to floor for a minute, then turned back with a steely eye. "We oughta coordinate."</p>
<p>“Had a new idea last fall. Don't just pull ‘em, move 'em. Make the fuckers go the wrong way.” I grinned at him. “Then just randomly move some all down the line every quarter mile. They'll have to recheck every stake. Same effect for a fraction of the work of pullin' them all up.”</p>
<p>"Like the way you think, brother." His smile revealed yellow teeth with a couple missing.</p>
<p>Rose emerged from the kitchen with a platter of carved roasted meat.</p>
<p>We adjourned to the dinner table. He and I sat while Rose served the meal. I moved to help, but she tutted me back into my seat.</p>
<p>The meat was antelope. What I had assumed were mashed potatoes instead seemed to be swedes. The string beans, home canned.</p>
<hr>
<p>I turned to Rose and said, "and you're sure you're ok with this?"</p>
<p>Rose said, "The Lord did not make mistakes in how he made people. We need to honor what He gave us. If you can help make Tom happy with the Lord's gifts, then it is God's glory fulfilled."</p>
<p>A novel view of Christianity that I had not encountered.</p>
<hr>
<p>About three inches of snow had fallen since the path to the first tourist cabin across the court yard had last seen a shovel. Tom pushed the door open. I followed him in.</p>
<p>The small room had a tiny wood stove radiating heat, a table and chairs from Tom’s hand, bed laden with wool blankets over flannel sheets.</p>
<p>I stomped my feet on the threshold, trying to avoid tracking snow inside. Once we shed out coats and boots, he pulled out a chair from the table and sat. I walked around the side of the bed and sat facing him.</p>
<p>The silence soon got awkward, so I broke it. “Tom, there’s a story that I don’t know, maybe I don’t need to know. What can I do for you?”</p>
<hr>
<p>"Sarah said you like beaded earrings, but you only wear one." Rose</p>
<p>looked hard to my right ear and then shifted over to my right ear. She nodded.</p>
<p>I didn't have an earring in. "I wear one in my left ear at the bar."</p>
<p>She turned to the table by the door and picked up a beaded earring: bold black and red chevrons with turquoise band at the top. "I made this for you. Thank you for making Tom happy." She handed it to me.</p>
<p>"This is beautiful. Thank you."</p>
<p>"Listen, when you see Tom again, just say your name. I think it's his eyes. He just doesn't see people very well."</p>
<p>"Ok, I kinda wondered." I stepped into the mudroom to put my boots back on.</p>
<p>I drove back to Railroad Creek Ranch with a crowded mind.</p>
