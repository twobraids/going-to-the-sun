                  <p>This is just another sketch.<br />Not sure if it's really part of this arc.</p>

                  <p>The <i>clickable</i> symbol <b><span id="Ustart" class=orange>&#x25CF;</span></b> indicates an <br />

            <p>With my Subaru parked on the snowbank in front of the Horned Owl Motel, I pushed through the snow to the front door. Rose opened the door just as I approached.</p>
<p>My first impression—happiness.</p>
<p>She ushered me into the mud room to shed my boots.</p>
<p>Once inside the heated space, I marveled at Tom's carpentry. Twenty years earlier, he had taken an abandoned square log house and a flock of tiny log cabins and built an eclectic iconic motel on the main tourist street. The carved filigree with log walls earned "charming" in Sunset Magazine a few years back.</p>
<p>I suspected he had made all the furniture, too.</p>
<p>Of course I knew him. His motel was across the alley from where I briefly work as a programmer for Bill last year. The day before Bill fired me, I met Tom for the first time sitting on a bench behind the motel smoking joint. As I stormed out of Bill's place, Tom offered me a hit.  I knew he and Bill were tight. It felt staged.</p>
<p>Just like today felt staged.</p>
<p>My first gig for Sarah away from the Iron Horse, landed me a town on the Rez, for someone that I already met. No wonder she didn't send one of Dolph's guys with me.</p>
<p>Rose made my introduction to Tom formal. I hesitated in what I planned on saying, as Tom did not acknowledge knowing me at all—how could he not recognize me?</p>
<p>I followed his lead. We shook hands. I nearly fucked it up because it was a normal shake.</p>
<p>Tom escorted me to the dinner table. He and I sat while Rose served the meal. I moved to help, but she tutted me back into my seat.</p>
<p>The meal proceeded like an interview. Tom wanted to know about my political views. We generally stood on the same side but I braced for the Sovereign Citizen line.</p>
<p>"So you drive all the way from Kalispell?" He really went for the direct eye contact, like he was watching for my eyes to dilate in a lie.</p>
<p>I hesitated. "Well, no. I live at Railroad Creek. Gladys's place."</p>
<p>He started. "You're local?" Excitement clear in his voice, "That's just ten minutes away. How long you been here?"</p>
<p>"Uh." I paused again. "I'm just startin' my third year here."  I had seen him in the grocery store. I'd seen him at the Post Office.</p>
<p>However, when the conversation focused on the Badger-Two Medicine wilderness, we bonded as brothers.</p>
<p>"They’re gonna to try pushin' a road through from False Summit to the upper South Fork of the Two Medicine." Tom voice raised an octave as he got excited.</p>
<p>"Been pulling survey stakes since last spring." I confessed—felt a jolt of I-shouldn't-have-said-that.</p>
<p>He grinned at me then reached out with a firm grip on my shoulder. "Good man. We oughta coordinate."</p>
<p>“Had a new idea last fall. Move ‘em.” I grinned at him. “Show ‘em exactly what you’re doing. Make the road narrower and narrower, so the notice. Then move about five at a time every half mile on. It’s as effective as having pulled them all. They need to check every damn one.”</p>
<p>We consumed our meal: antelope, a starchy cup's-worth of what might have been swedes, and home canned string beans.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned to Rose and said, "and you're sure you're ok with this?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Rose said, "The Lord did not make mistakes in how he made people. We need to honor what He gave us. If you can help make Tom happy with the Lord's gifts, then it is God's glory fulfilled."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A novel view of Christianity that I had not encountered.</p>
<hr>
<p>"Sarah said you like beaded earrings, but you only wear one. Yes?" Rose peered into my eyes.</p>
