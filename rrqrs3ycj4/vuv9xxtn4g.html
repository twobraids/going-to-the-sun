            <h2 id="MidMorning,Whitefish,Montana">Mid Morning, Whitefish, Montana</h2>
<p>I woke lying on my right side, hearing a strange sound, a rhythmic grunting behind me. I opened my eyes and saw an unfamiliar room. Groggy and confused, I couldn't immediately recall where I was. I rolled over toward the sound to find Chris' face not a foot away from me.  I sat bolt upright in surprise, seeing Chris bent over the edge of the bed. Vince stood naked behind Chris, clearly fucking him.</p>
<p>"Go-od-morn-ing," Chris said with a big grin in Vince's thrusting rhythm, “did-n’t-mean-to-star-tle-you."</p>
<p>I sat frozen, making no response, in wide-eyed amazement.</p>
<p>Chris pushed himself up with his inked arms, saying, “Here, kneel in front of me. Give me your dick. I love getting it in both ends."</p>
<p>With an instantaneous, painful erection, I complied, pulling myself up onto my knees as I turned to face him directly. Readjusting to get closer, Chris lunged at my dick and swallowed me to my balls in one motion: from asleep to receiving my first-ever blow job in less than thirty seconds. I gasped at the heat, the smoothness, the slipperiness, the overwhelming primal urge to push. I drew back slightly and pushed in a second time, and the tingle of the inevitability blossomed deep in my groin.</p>
<p>"I can't hold it!" I pulled out and away from Chris. My first spasm arced a wad of cum over Chris's head, beyond his back, and splattered on Vince's face, forehead scar to chin. The second spasm, again over Chris's head, drew a similar line down the length of Chris's back. Somewhere in the distance, I heard Vince laughing. Chris lunged for my dick again, taking me into his mouth for the third spasm. I cried out with the overwhelming sensation somewhere between pain and pleasure. He held me fast in his mouth, taking each of my diminishing shots while I squirmed with an overload of too much sensation.</p>
<p>Like waking up for a second time, Vince's guttural laugh in my ears, the room refocused around me. I pulled my still-rigid dick from Chris's mouth.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry." I did that totally wrong, sex shouldn't end so fast.</p>
<p>"Sorry? More like fuckin' beautiful," Vince roared with my load dripping from his face.</p>
<p>"I've never done this before."</p>
<p>"I'm honored to be the first to suck you off. But you didn't give me the chance to really do anything." Chris gave me a wicked grin.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I couldn't hold it."</p>
<p>Chris's grin turned into a frown. "Oh, stop your fucking apologizing, there's nothing to be sorry about. Looking at how hard your dick still is, I don't think you're done.”</p>
<p>"You blow guys, but nobody ever blown you? I suppose you've never fucked either. Get back here. Take over for me. You won't be so quick to shoot this time."</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah, take a turn in my ass." Chris's grin reappeared.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I rolled this new concept around in my mind. I always assumed that an orgasm ended sex: ejection from the game. Elated by a second chance, I climbed off the edge of the bed. On seeing Chris bent over in profile, I realized the bed stood much higher than a normal one. They had optimized it with the perfect height for the convenience of fucking like this. No awkward stooping down or tiptoeing stretching, at least for Vince's greater height.</p>
<p>Vince pulled out and stepped to the side, gesturing an invitation to insert my dick into his lover's ass. I couldn't reach. Recognizing my trouble, Vince pulled a wooden box from under the bed and positioned it between Chris's legs. I couldn't help but think that the convenient proximity of the box indicated that I wasn't the first guy getting a booster to reach Chris's ass.</p>
<p>For the next half hour, I had the more physical pleasure than I thought possible: so like my new experiences of carving a motorcycle through a long series of tight curves at high speed, living in the moment totally within my body, the animal brain in exquisite perfect command. We were three men together enjoying all the pleasures that we could give one another, my true introduction to gay sex. This felt right. This felt natural. This rang out as fulfilling my body's true calling. Our session ended with me climaxing deeply inside Chris while holding him, my chest to his back, my arms around him with my hands curled onto his shoulders. I've never felt so fulfilled, satisfied, and happy.</p>
<p>Sated for the moment, we all showered together in the bedroom's adjoining tiled bathroom. Of course, inspired by the slippery, soapy proximity of these men, I got hard again. This time, Vince sucked my dick until a shot out my third load of the hour.</p>
<p>"Hell, to be your age again." Vince gave me a wistful smile.</p>
<h2 id="LateMorning">Late Morning</h2>
<p>We returned to the bedroom to dry and dress. Seeing my new riding leathers casually piled on the floor reminded me of Ted and today’s scheduled ride. Speaking up with urgency, "I'm supposed to be riding with David and Ted. What time is it?" Looking urgently around the room, then seeing 11:10 on the bedside clock, my shoulders slumped in frustration. "We were supposed to be riding over Going to the Sun highway today."</p>
<p>“Either they ditched you, or they’re holed up somewhere waitin’. You set a meet-up spot or what?" Vince started toweling his beard.</p>
<p>"No, they expected me back at the motel last night. David won't wait for me."</p>
<p>"Call the motel, see if they're still there. There's a phone downstairs." Chris pulled his jeans on.</p>
<p>"Where'd they bed down last night?" Vince pulled on his "Boss" tank top shirt.</p>
<p>"The Glacier View."</p>
<p>I saw it only for an instant on the door hook: the backside of a leather jacket with a denim overlay, with a gang patch displaying "Bitterroot Bastards MC" split and curved over the top and under the bottom of a mountain peak and a motorcycle.</p>
<p>I knew that name.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A memory surfaced from my high school days, a TV news report: a motorcycle gang, narcotics distribution, prison sentences, a mugshot of an angry, longhaired, bearded man with intense pale blue eyes. He about stopped my heart. The confusing arousal I felt from this intense face staring into my sixteen-year-old eyes through the television had stuck with me ever since.</p>
<p>Vince pulled the door open, turning the jacket from my view.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Sarah will know the phone number," Chris assured me. We walked into a hallway where I could smell cooking bacon. Hunger pushed jacket from my mind.</p>
<p>Once downstairs, I discovered the amazing architecture of this house: big vaulted log ceiling, stone fireplace, two-story glass wall to the southeast framing both the Swan and Mission mountains in the distance. The open expanse from the window stretched through the living room to the kitchen.</p>
<p>A woman cooking in the kitchen turned when she heard us. Her face shifted from a smile, to surprise, to wary concern. “I heard you guys going at it upstairs and figured I’d make you breakfast. Didn't expect company. Who’s your guest?”</p>
<p>Vince stepped up trying to smooth the sudden tension.  “Karl, this is Sarah, my wife." Then he said to her, "He’s... new. We’re workin' on him. Thinkin' maybe our first <i>family</i> dealer down at the Horse."</p>
<p>“Hey!” Chris objected, “what the fuck am I then?”</p>
<p>Vince and Chris laughed, Sarah did not. Vince rephrased, “first non-family, <i>family</i> dealer.”</p>
<p>Sarah's brow furrowed more deeply. “Not your usual method of persuasion.”</p>
<p>"I pick the right tool for the job,” he answered while grabbing his crotch. “Always lead with the tasty carrot. Stick’s only in case they get stupid.”</p>
<p>Sarah looked me up and down. "You met him last night and already brought him home?"</p>
<p>Chris turned to face her. "He's got potential."</p>
<p>Sarah didn’t argue, but she didn’t look convinced either.</p>
<p>I stood there like an idiot, unsure if I was supposed to shake her hand, salute, or apologize—how does Vince have a wife?</p>
<p>I kept glancing her way, trying not to stare. She looked like Miss Nelson, the high school algebra teacher who always made me feel stupid. Same sharp posture, same unshakable confidence, the kind that left no room for guessing. Close-cropped hair, clear eyes, dressed in a T-shirt and jeans. Not conventionally pretty, but striking—impossible to ignore.</p>
<p>I stood there too long, feeling lost, as Chris broke through to me, “You need to call your friends?"</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, I need a phone book”</p>
<p>Vince asked Sarah, “You know the number for Glacier View?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Sarah looked confused. “‘Course I do. Already talked to ‘em. How the hell do you know about this? Linda called me early this mornin'. You were still snorin’.”</p>
<p>Vince frowned. “Karl's tryin' to catch up with his riding crew. Am I missin' somethin'?”</p>
<p>“Had trouble at Glacier View last night. One of my girls, Linda, some asshole roughed her up. She’s out a week, maybe more.” Sarah responded.</p>
<p>Anger swept across Vince's face. “You get the fucker?”</p>
<p>“Nah, sent Dolph and Bull over real early this mornin'.  He. was long gone. We need a guy there full-time. No more dragging ass on this, I want that dump next to the Horse renovated. We need it. Fuck the Glacier View."</p>
<p>“Sarah, we’ve talked about this. Cherry’s harvesting, he ain’t coming back ‘til it’s done.”</p>
<p>“There’s other carpenters, Vince.”</p>
<p>“Cherry’s a brother. You get the Glacier View guy’s name?”</p>
<p>Sarah glared at Vince for a moment, “Yeah, got an address in Spokane. No damn reason to think it’s real. Already sent word to the guys in Coeur d’Alene, they’ll check it out and get back to us.”</p>
<p>I got really uncomfortable with the obvious tension between them. My mind twisted between wanting to get away and wanting to know more about these fascinating people. I cleared my throat. “I still need the phone.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Chris said, leading me to a phone near a desk to the side of the kitchen. I picked the phone book off the desk, but Sarah came over, picked up the receiver, tapped the number, and handed it to me.</p>
<p>I heard the three of them talking about the trouble at the motel while I asked the desk clerk if Ted Barnett had already checked out. Before I even hung up, my thoughts twisted in a fight—no ride over Going to the Sun—more time with Vince and Chris.</p>
<p>Chris gave me an inquiring look.</p>
<p>I shook my head. “No. Said they checked out an hour ago."</p>
<p>Chris smiled. "Damn, buddy, guess that means you’ll have to spend some more time with us.” I gave a weak smile back, as everyone gathered food and plates and brought them over to the table.</p>
<p>My mind returned to the paradox of Sarah as we ate our breakfast. She obviously knows about Vince and Chris. Does Vince sleep with her, too? How common are guys that go both ways? David used to have a wife.</p>
<p>She kept drilling me with her eyes. I kept my eyes on my plate only daring to dart glances at her every so often.</p>
<p>Chris, picking up on the tension, retold the story of my poker game last night to Sarah. I recognized that the story already morphed, amplifying my prowess with the cards. I didn't correct him.</p>
<p>I kept thinking I needed to participate in smalltalk. I ought to say something. Near the end of the meal, my curiosity overtook my shyness and I blurted out the question to Sarah, "Do you two have children?"</p>
<p>From either end of the table, a stereo answer came, "Hell, no" and "My God, no!" Everyone but me laughed.</p>
<p>Chris spoke up for me. "Karl is green, not a lot of experience. We're the first gay men he's ever met."</p>
<p>Vince, looked at me. "Marriage is for show. Ain’t into women. Never have been.”</p>
<p>"I don't do men." Sarah added, “Jesus, it was rough listenin’ to you guys rutting like hogs.  Figured it was Rook up there with you."</p>
<p>Vince and Chris laughed, and then Chris followed through with a respectable pig squeal.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0073" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned to Sarah. "I get it. You're a... umm..."</p>
<p>Sarah took over. "The word’s lesbian. Vince and Chris run the bar. I run the girls. Business is business.”</p>
<p>"Run the girls?" I didn't understand that at all.</p>
<p>"The hookers, the prostitutes." She sounded annoyed with my ignorance.</p>
<p>It took a moment but it dawned on me. "Oh, I always assumed they did their own thing. Guess I've never really thought about it." Then I blurted out the stupidest question of my life, "How come there are no male hookers?"</p>
<p>Both Chris and Vince instantly broke out laughing. "You mean like you?"</p>
<p>I felt my face flush hot, knowing I had turned beet red.</p>
<p>Sarah's expression changed entirely, from annoyance to confusion begging for an explanation.</p>
<p>I didn't say anything, too embarrassed that Chris had said that.</p>
<p>Chris answered for me, "The buddy he railroaded at the poker table last night pays Karl for blow jobs."</p>
<p>"So that's what's this is all about." She sounded exasperated. "Never known you guys to pay for it." She set down her coffee and drilled into me. “You charge by the job, or by the hour?”</p>
<p>I sat there dumbfounded. I didn't answer and lowered my gaze to the table.</p>
<p>She smirked. “You ever think about doin’ it somewhere you don’t gotta watch your back? I could use a new pretty face in the roster. Maybe got a niche for you.”</p>
<p>Vince spoke up with anger. "Sarah, back off."</p>
<p>I looked up in time to see them glaring at each other.</p>
<p>We finished the meal mostly in silence, Chris cleared the table, sorted the dishes into the dishwasher, and cleaned up the kitchen.</p>
<p>Sarah got up and left the room without word.</p>
<p>Vince turned to me. "Bar opens back up at two. You gotta hit the highway east, or you stickin’ around another day? Wanna see you work a table, dealin’."</p>
<p>I loved the idea of spending another night, but Sarah made it clear that I wasn't supposed to be there. I think my lips parted, but I didn't manage to answer his question.</p>
<p>Vince acted as if that whole exchange with Sarah hadn't happened. "Tomorrow and Tuesday’s our weekend. Sarah runs the bar while we're off. Ain’t ridden Logan Pass in a couple years. You missed your run with your buddies, we’ll go with you up there tomorrow, if you’re up for it."</p>
<p>Distracted by the offer, my eyes widened. "I'd like that."</p>
<p>"Gonna have to upgrade your scoot, though. Chris, what d’you think?, Ironhead Sporty?" Vince queried.</p>
<p>"Yeah, good fit. Colors?"</p>
<p>"Can’t earn respect if they never see us.”</p>
<p>I didn't know the term. “What does ‘upgrade my scoot’ mean?”</p>
<p>“We’re gettin’ you on a different bike. Nothin’ wrong with your Honda, but if you’re ridin’ with us, you need somethin’ that says the right thing."</p>
<p>"The right thing? You sound like David," I protested, "besides, my bike ends up stuck here, and your Ironhead thingy is stuck over on the east side."</p>
<p>"Thingy?" Chris said with mock indignation.</p>
<p>Vince stepped in again. "Call it incentive. Want you to come back and work for us. Your Honda'll be safe here,"</p>
<p>"I don't own the bike. I can't just leave it somewhere."</p>
<p>Vince shook his head. "Ain’t gotta worry, it’s safe. We’re givin’ you a Harley. Just take it and quit fussin’.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0104" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I felt torn. I didn't like Vince ordering me what to do, but he's offering me a Harley. I've dreamed of riding a Harley. I paused for a few moments, thinking of his earlier statement to Sarah about carrots and sticks.</p>
<p>“OK, I'll do it." I heard the note trepidation leaking out through my voice.</p>
<p>"Good call. Chris, take Karl out to the bike barn—show him his new ride."</p>
<h2 id="EarlyAfternoon">Early Afternoon</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0108" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris led me out of the kitchen through the mudroom to a large metal-frame building to the east side of the house. He unlocked the side door, and we entered a cavernous space half-filled with motorcycles. Chris pressed a wall button, and an electric motor sparked into life, opening the closer of two garage doors large enough to admit one of those enormous Winnebago motorhomes. The sunlight revealed the second bay of the garage served as a motorcycle shop. A couple of empty pneumatic bike lifts, wheeled tool chests, and workbenches crowded the space.</p>
<p>There must have been twenty motorcycles in there: big baggers, raked-out custom choppers, lots of shovelheads, some panheads, and I even spotted an old knucklehead against the back wall. In the second row, Chris approached an Ironhead Sportster with a sparkly golden-brown tank air-brushed with contrasting yellow and orange flames.</p>
<p>I gaped at the collection. "Why do you have so many bikes?"</p>
<p>"Vince and I have five between us. The rest are projects or stashed for our brothers.”</p>
<p>Chris walked over to the Sportster, grabbed the handlebars, pulled in the clutch, and kicked the bike up into neutral. Pushing it off the stand, he wheeled it out onto the garage apron in the sun, knocked the stand back down, and leaned the bike into its resting position "This will be your bike for a while."</p>
<p>In awe, all I could say was, "Oh, wow."</p>
<p>Chris started going over the bike, inspecting the moving components while showing me the features. "This is a '76 model, after they made the shift pattern sane."</p>
<p>"Sane?"</p>
<p>“Pre-‘75, shifter was on the right, not the left. Backwards, too—down meant up, up meant down. This one’s just like your Honda, though, ‘cept it’s a four-speed, not five.” He ran a hand over the tank. “Engine’s twice the size of what you’re used to. More torque, lower RPMs. You don’t have to wring it out like the Honda. That’s why it don’t need a fifth gear. You’ll get the feel fast. Hell, after an afternoon on this, bet you won’t wanna touch that Honda again.”</p>
<p>"How is it on the curves?"</p>
<p>“Well, that’s one thing your Honda’s got over it. This Ironhead’s a hundred pounds heavier, higher center of gravity. It’ll pull you outta curves harder, but it isn’t as planted inside ‘em. Gotta be careful ‘til you get the feel for it.”</p>
<p>Chris spent the next twenty minutes checking me out on the bike. He dutifully explained maintenance and safety inspections. On checking the tire pressure, he found them both low. Pulling down on a long pneumatic tube hanging just inside the doorway, he brought them up to pressure. An unseen compressor motor whined in the back of the shop bay soon after he started and then stopped a few moments after he completed the inflation.</p>
<p>“We’re gonna ride down to the Horse today. Let's suit up."</p>
<p>We walked back over to the house and reentered through the mudroom. I heard shouting, Vince and Sarah in an arguemnt. As Chris pulled the door open, their raised voices stopped, before he stepped in.</p>
<p>Chris turned to me and rolled his eyes. He announced to Vince, "I got him oriented on the Ironhead. He'll be fine. He asked the right questions."</p>
<p>Sarah looked at us and shook her head. She turned and walked briskly to the door that Chris and I had just come through. She reached up and snagged a key from a key hook just left of the doorway. She stopped and turned back toward Vince. “I’ll lock up the Horse for you tonight, but I'm not gettin’ there until nine or so. You owe me for this.” She slammed the door.</p>
<p>Chris watched Sarah leave and then turned and looked at Vince. He shrugged.</p>
<p>"Let's take the long way today. The chops. Colors. Feelin' it," Vince said cryptically.</p>
<p>"Oh, sure," said Chris, "Do a couple lines first?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, take the edge off." Vince shot a wide grin to his lover.</p>
<p>Chris walked over to the hutch against the wall beyond the table. He opened a lower cabinet and brought out a polished wooden box. He placed it on the table, opened it and drew out a mirror and a small brown glass screw-top vial.</p>
<p>Sitting down in a chair, he carefully poured a little conical pile of white powder in the middle of the mirror. He picked up a razor blade, sculpting the pile into three thin lines of powder.</p>
<p>I stepped up to look. "Cocaine?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, uncut." He looked up at me, "Just like you and Vince. Lucky bastards."</p>
<p>Vince laughed.</p>
<p>"I bought a gram once in college in Bozeman. I thought it was kind of a worthless high for the price. There were a few good uses for it, though."</p>
<p>Chris looked up at me. "It was probably cut a hundred times."</p>
<p>Holding a little brown glass tube, Chris bent over the table, inserted one end of the tube into a nostril, and vacuumed the line off the mirror. He sat up quickly with a long exhale through his mouth. He flared his nostrils a few times before leaning back into his seat.</p>
<p>Vince followed, repeating Chris' actions. Afterwards, he offered the glass tube to me.</p>
<p>I shook my head. "I'm not really hot on it, honestly."</p>
<p>"Oh, you gotta try it. This is really clean shit."</p>
<p>"Nah."</p>
<p>“So, no booze, no blow… what, you got a membership card for the Christian Ladies Temperance League tucked in your wallet?”</p>
<p>“We prefer to call ourselves a gang.”</p>
<p>Vince still held the glass tube. "You really ain't takin' this line?"</p>
<p>"No, thank you. I'm a dedicated pot smoker and happy with that."</p>
<p>"Sure as hell, we'll find another way to corrupt you." He shrugged and snorted up the other line. He sat up twitching his nose. "So how’d you end up usin’ your gram?"</p>
<p>"Two practical uses and one recreational. Nothing compares to its ability to stop the itch of a mosquito bite to save a night's sleep. It's really great to numb a toothache or a canker sore to get through a meal," I explained.</p>
<p>"and for fun?"</p>
<p>"Take your straw, pack the end with a tiny bit of coke, hold the coke end of the straw in your mouth getting the coke as close as you can to the back of your throat without gagging, then inhale really fast, like a gasp. The coke sprays out over the back of your throat. With your throat numbed, you can take an incredibly huge bong hit without any chance of choking," I explained, "The friend that taught me that called it a 'frosty'."</p>
<p>Chris started laughing. "Thank God, I was afraid you had no vices. Have you ever had Thai black hash?"</p>
<p>"I've rarely ever been able to get hash. What's black hash?"</p>
<p>"Give me a minute," Chris rose from his chair and trotted out of the room.</p>
<p>I sat back down at the table facing Vince. "Are you the type of guys that we were told to avoid in those anti-drug films we saw in high school health class?"</p>
<p>"Ooooh, yes," he answered in his deepest voice.</p>
<p>"The films never said anything about sucking your dick and letting me fuck your buddy's ass."</p>
<p>"If they ain’t sayin' nothin’, means it’s fine."</p>
<p>Chris came back into the room with another small, polished wooden box, a metal pipe, and a lighter. Setting them down on the table, he opened the box, pulled out a small bag containing an oblong, flattened blob of a very dark black substance about three inches in the long diameter.  After only a few moments exposed to the air, I could smell the hash fragrance. Using his pocket knife, he peeled a thin slice from it.</p>
<p>I sat up and leaned forward for a closer look. "It's soft?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, like putty."</p>
<p>"It smells wonderful. I've never seen anything like it. Any hash I've ever had was hard greenish cube, tough to cut."</p>
<p>"This is fresh and strong." He loaded it into the bowl of the hash pipe and then handed it to me along with the lighter.</p>
<p>I heated the bowl with the lighter and saw the hash become bubbly and start to smoke. I drew on the pipe, and the hash started to burn slowly. I coughed almost immediately, barely getting anything in my lungs. The flavor and scent, though, brought a cascade of happy memories of hash smoking while backpacking in the Spanish Peaks southwest of Bozeman a few years ago.</p>
<p>Vince already reopened the cocaine bottle and tapped out a bit on the glass. Using a tiny, long-handled spoon, he tamped a bit of coke into the glass straw and offered it to me.</p>
<p>I took it and demonstrated the frosty technique. It worked a charm. I drew a huge lungful without coughing. I held it a few moments and exhaled toward the ceiling. I felt the rush of THC in my system instantly. “Goddamn, that's powerful shit." I set the pipe down on the table.</p>
<p>Vince took up the glass straw, loaded it, executed the gasp. He took up the hash pipe, sparked up the lighter, taking a huge hit. "Oh, dang, that fuckin' works." He started to laugh. "Probably just torched my own damn throat. Won’t even feel it for a couple hours."</p>
<p>Chris followed through, copying my technique. He nodded at me with a big smile of approval. I smiled back, thrilled that I could introduce new experiences to them in exchange for what they had shown me in the last few hours.</p>
<p>Vince stood up and said in a loud, commanding voice, "Gentlemen, let's ride."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0166" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A few minutes later, we reconvened at the garage, suited up in our riding leathers.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0167" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince wore that Bitterroot Bastards overlay on his jacket that I had seen on the back of the door. Chris had one, too. No doubt now: not a souvenir wall decoration. Vince and Chris were actually members of a one-percenter biker group.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0168" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Both thrilled and terrified, my mind raced with the implications. Gay one-percenters? New concept. They were so nice, how could they be gang members?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0169" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince pushed his chopper out. The relatively tiny front tire sat alone way out in front of the bike on chrome springer forks that surely must rake out nearly forty-five degrees. The hard tail back end with a tall granny bar spiking up into the air looked aggressive and, frankly, dangerous.</p>
<p>Chris' chopper was a little less extreme but with the same springer fork and bulbous eyeball of a headlight centered between the ape-hanger handlebars.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0171" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince pumped the kick starter a few times to prime the engine. His powerful stomp down startled me. The bike effortlessly choked into life with a rapid sequence of bluish blasts of exhaust out the upward-angled fishtail pipes.</p>
<p>An instant later, Chris did the same thing, but with a slightly different technique. Being a smaller guy than Vince, he had to leverage his weight by nearly jumping onto the kickstarter, igniting his engine into life.</p>
<p>I felt a little inadequate as I pulled the enricher knob out and pressed the button on the handlebars. The Sportster coughed once and immediately settled into the classic Harley syncopated idle. It had a more conservative muffler system, significantly more throaty than the purr of my Honda, but far less than the clattering rumble of their bikes.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of warm-up and enricher adjustments, Vince signaled to move out. He kicked into gear and rolled down the right track of the two-track driveway. Chris motioned me to follow, and I naturally took the left track. Chris then followed behind me on the right track.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0175" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We rode south, and I had no mental map of where we were. A sign indicating MT424 flashed by, didn't know it. When the highway turned east, we soon switched to a road called Valley Drive aiming us back south again. Really getting uncomfortable that I knew our heading but not our position, I kept thinking US2 ought to be ahead, but it didn't come and didn't come.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0176" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Were we south of US2? I tensed up and mis-shifted while heading up a steep hill lugging the engine. Quickly correcting, pulling in the clutch, downshifting, then releasing the clutch while revving the engine. The engine roared in protest of me down shifting too far, the bike slowed abruptly, and Chris rode my ass. I shook my head, shifted up again, accelerating back to the correct speed, feeling like an idiot.</p>
<p>We crested the hill and I could see a major intersection about a mile ahead. It had enough traffic to be US2—relief.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0178" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We turned left on the highway heading east into Kalispell. In just another mile, I realized my uncle's house, my father's brother, stood to the left of the highway at the next top of the hill. It slid by, while I remembered visiting every couple of years as a kid.</p>
<p>Once in town, we met with US93, turned south again, and rode south out of town. At the north end of Flathead Lake, we switched to eastbound MT82, a highway familiar to me. Eventually, we turned north on MT35 following exactly the same path that David, Ted, and I rode—yesterday? Just yesterday? We rejoined US2 at Columbia Falls, rolled by the Glacier View Motel, and weaved through side streets emerging at the railroad tracks and the Iron Horse.</p>
<h2 id="MidAfternoon">Mid Afternoon</h2>
<p>Six bikes already sat out front, and about a dozen cars sat in the side lot. We parked in line with the bikes, this time without me exiled to a lower-status parking spot.</p>
<p>The moment I got off the bike, I approached Chris. "I'm sorry. I got flustered in shifting on that hill."</p>
<p>"Jesus, Karl, quit apologizin’ for every damn thing. So you botched a shift on a bike you’ve never ridden. Big deal. You adapted. Gonna take a helluva lot more than that to break it. Get over yourself."</p>
<p>He turned to Vince. "Yo Vince, when are you going to adjust those lifters? You're startin' to sound like an old pinball machine."</p>
<p>Vince did not reply.</p>
<p>Once inside, Chris and I went straight to the card room to set up my card dealing audition. My eyes instantly seized on my Honda sitting by the wall where I had pushed it twelve hours ago. I felt as if I had betrayed a friend by riding, and worse, enjoying, the Sportster.</p>
<p>As there were very few patrons in the bar, only one dealer dealt for three early afternoon players. We set up at the table furthest from the doorway. A couple of the idle dealers came into the room, apparently directed to do so by Vince. Chris walked over to the cashier, signing out several racks of chips and a couple of card decks from Judy, the cashier. He gave them to me, showing me the secure drawers of the dealer box at the poker table.</p>
<p>As I put a deck into the open bin, I held up the other deck. “The seal is broken."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0189" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Oh, yeah. Sorry, fouled seal, didn't want to waste it. This isn't a real game, just use it."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0190" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You want me to count them?" I held the deck up</p>
<p><b><span id="U0191" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He shook his head. "I figure you know how to count."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0192" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris introduced the other dealers, Bill and Nancy. Vince strode into the room and joined the table. As this was a faux game, I set them each up with a hundred bucks in chips.</p>
<p>"So what are we playing today? 5-card? 7-card? Texas Hold'em or just a tarot reading?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0194" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris spoke up, "Seven Stud is what we—"</p>
<p>Vince interrupted, "How the hell you read tarot with a poker deck?"</p>
<p>Chris turned a wide-eyed, brow-furrowed face to Vince.</p>
<p>Speaking from my ass, I said, "Of course, cards are cards. The association between a true tarot deck and a poker deck isn't perfect, but it's well established."</p>
<p>Vince took on a skeptical expression. "Show me."</p>
<p>Chris turned his apprehensive look to me, subtly shaking his head as if trying to stop me. I pressed on.</p>
<p>"Your shirt tells me you're the boss, so I'll deal what you tell me to deal," Feeling cocky, I started shuffling while simultaneously explaining. "Tarot, like Texas Hold'em, is just a game show. It's all about style and presentation." I shuffled the deck seven times using several showy techniques, starting with a strip cut, the Hindu, a classic riffle, a chunky Mongean, an imperfect Farrow, and then another two riffles with fancy bridges. I squared the deck and snapped it down in front of Vince. "Please cut the deck."</p>
<p>Looking directly at Vince as he cut them, I saw menace. His furrowed brow made his scar look angry. I resquared the halves and theatrically spun out five cards, face down, in a straight line in front of him.</p>
<p>"Choose the card that represents you and flip it over." He turned over the leftmost card: A♠. I continued, "Perfect to represent you, the ace of spades, big, bold, and dangerous. That’s you right now. You’re sharp, you’re in control, but there’s a weight to it. People may not entirely understand you and, maybe, even fear you."</p>
<p>"Choose your challenge and turn it over." He picked the rightmost card: 10♣. "This is what crosses you, puts you in conflict: responsibility. You carry a lot of weight. Make a wrong step, and does the whole thing come crashing down?" Vince didn't look at the card. He looked straight at me, drilling with his eyes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0204" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Select your past and turn it over." He turned over the center card, Q♥. "Ahh, the Queen of Hearts, bold with emotion. There is a love in your past, maybe it gave you something, but to fulfill it did you have to leave something behind?" I thought of Vince's odd connection with Sarah, and realized I was barreling into trouble. Chris now just looked down at the felt. Jesus, this is a stupid charade. Why did I start this?</p>
<p>"Select your advice." He turned over 5♦. "Five of diamonds. This represents change. Is there something you need to give up? Sometimes you need to lose a game to win the match."</p>
<p>"Finally, turn over your future." He flipped over K♥, the suicide king. I faltered a moment on explaining the card, but then said, struggling to adjust my voice to feign confident competence,  "The King of Hearts. This is your future: a leader who’s strong but the kind of leader who knows when to make decisions with his heart instead of with his head.” Adding in a foolish attempt to make light of this farce, “For example, like when making a decision on hiring a dealer that needs the job."</p>
<p>Clearly, I got nervous chuckles from the two dealers, but Chris and Vince stayed silent. Vince locked eyes with me. “Where’d you learn to do this?"</p>
<p>"I didn't. I know nothing about tarot. I made it all up. You told me to give you a tarot reading, and I ad-libbed my way through it. Shall we start a real game now, or if you'd prefer, Texas Hold'em?" I spotted Chris shut his eyes.</p>
<p>Vince grimaced, "You bluffed that pretty good, right up ‘til that last card. Suicide King ain’t the future, it’s destiny. And that’s got a hell of a darker meaning than..." then mincing the words in mockery,  "...making decisions with your heart."</p>
<p>Horror flashed through my body—I fucked up—Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>"I grew up in Western Star Shows, a traveling carnival. From '40 'til she died in '62 in her tent, my ma was Mystic Mary, the fortune teller." He continued with a clear, stern voice, simmering with anger, "You’re a first-class bullshitter. For your sake, you better be one hell of a dealer, ‘cause that’s the only reason you’re still sittin’ here. You pull that shit again, you won’t be. You don’t know a damn thing about tarot. And you sure as hell ain’t gonna mock the ones who do. You wanna keep your hands in one piece? Then you keep ‘em off things you don’t get."</p>
<p>I felt my face flush and I bowed my head in supplication. Fuck, fuck, fuck, I just blew it. Vince’s tempered fury scared me down to my bones.  I drew in a deep breath. "I offer my sincerest apology. I'm sorry for making light of something I truly know nothing about. I will never do it again."</p>
<p>"Deal stud. Now."</p>
<p>I quickly gathered the cards on the table, rejoining them with the rest of the deck, and I began shuffling again. Looking around the table, Bill and Nancy, the two dealers, sat straight upright, eyes trained on the felt, looking very uncomfortable. Chris still had his eyes closed.</p>
<p>For the next forty minutes, we flew through twelve hands with no faults or gaffes on my part. At the table, Chris won most of the pots, though, as these were fake games; nobody played aggressively.</p>
<p>The thirteenth game, however, broke the pattern. Just as I was about to deal the sixth street cards, a large stack of what sounded like metal buffet pans went crashing to the floor at the bussing station near the door behind and to my right. All my players turned to look. While startled, I forcefully kept my eyes on the felt just as I was taught at the Ox years earlier. In that instant of everyone's distraction, Chris’s hands passed over his hole cards. I could not believe what I had just seen—the unsealed deck.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0217" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Only an instant later, everyone turned back to the game, seeing me frozen with the first sixth street card in my hand. A tense moment passed before I spoke, "Gentlemen, Ma’am, I must put this game on hold for a moment. Please bear with me."</p>
<p>Then to Chris, I asked with an artificially steady voice, "Who is the floor manager here today?"</p>
<p>Chris looked at me. "I am."</p>
<p>"May we have a private word?"</p>
<p>"Speak to the table."</p>
<p>“OK," pausing for a moment, taking a deep breath, composing myself, and then calmly placing my neck on the guillotine. "I believe this deck is two cards short. The two missing cards are now on the felt in front of you. The hole cards that I dealt to you are in your left hand."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0223" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Another moment of silence passed with no reaction from Chris.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0224" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I continued. "I suspect that the cards on the felt are the Ace of Hearts and the Ace of Diamonds."</p>
<p>Vince reached over to Chris’s hole cards and flipped them over. Sure enough, I was exactly correct. A♥ and A♦ stared up at us all.  Chris laughed, rotated his left hand up, revealing his original hole cards. He turned to Vince. “I told you he’d be good.”</p>
<p>Vince looked over to me with incredulity. "How the hell did you know that?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0227" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Alan at the Ox trained us to never look away from the felt. He used to say, 'even if the bar is on fire'. Chris passed his hands over his hole cards while everyone looked toward the noise. The deck he made me start with wasn't sealed. Ever notice how winning Ace hole cards stand out in game? There haven't been very many since we started and none of them were red. Look at his board, you can't look at that and not wonder where the other Aces are."</p>
<p>"Jesus Christ, Karl, you’re a damn card counter?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0229" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No. Card counting is a Blackjack skill, maybe slightly useful in Seven Card, useless in Hold’em. I'm a computer programmer, I see patterns. Sometimes things just stand out. The three of spades has not shown up either, but the missing aces are valuable, so I guess they just lit up in my mind. We’ve played enough games that I should have seen them by now.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0230" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince, again locking his eyes on me, but saying to his partner, “Chris, you're in charge of the card room. Hire him if you want to. It’s your choice. I don't need to see another damn game.” He turned to Chris. "If you take him, he’s in the fuckin’ box next private club party. I want  brainiac watchin’ every goddamn card on the felt.”</p>
<p>Vince stood up and walked out of the room without another word.</p>
<p>Chris then rose from his chair. On surveying the room and seeing newly arrived players with no games to join, he told Bill and Nancy to quickly start up their tables. They rushed off, following his orders. I gathered the cards and squared them, then realizing that I couldn't do anything more with them, so I dropped them in the discard bin. Chris gathered and reracked the chips.</p>
<p>"Did you signal someone to cause that crash of trays?"</p>
<p>"Of course, Dolph did it, we got signals, the card room is always watched.  I couldn’t resist that four-of-a-kind hand."</p>
<p>"Do you always test dealers’ ability to detect cheating?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do. We’re a biker bar, guys pull shit all the time. I got lots of ways to test a dealer."</p>
<p>"Did I miss anything else?"</p>
<p>“Technically, yeah, you agreed to start a game with an open deck, but c’mon, I’m not holdin’ that against you. What I am lookin’ for is a dealer who does exactly what I tell ‘em. I want you in the box. So, you takin’ the job or what?”</p>
<p>I didn't hesitate. “Yes." I needed the job—fucking rationalization.</p>
<p>“Can’t start today. Gotta wait ‘til Monday to run your license,  tomorrow.”</p>
<p>He smirked, shifting gears. “Honestly? Thought Vince was about to fold you in half. You waltzed straight into some deep shit. If you’d screwed up your dealing, he’d have tossed your ass straight onto the  tracks out back.”</p>
<p>"How long is he going to be mad at me?" My voice sounded remote.</p>
<p>“For once, your whole sorry-for-existing routine actually made sense. Vince can be a goddamn thunderstorm, lightning bolts flyin’ every which way. Just like the weather, give him thirty minutes, he's all rainbows and fucking sunshine.”</p>
<p>Chris put his hand on my shoulder. "Remember, Vince is president of the club; his word is law. We're not a big club anymore, but we're still here."</p>
<p>"I can't remember something that you've never told me. Can I ask some questions about this, uh, club? I don't understand."</p>
<p>"Not now, I've got to get to work. Ask tonight when we get back to the house."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Vince strode back into the card room carrying a bottle of beer in one hand and a beer mug in the other. He stepped right up to me. "Try this. Tell me if it’s worth stockin’ at the bar."</p>
<p>Looking totally confused, I reminded him, "I can't drink beer. I don't know anything about beer."</p>
<p>"Ain’t beer. It’s a soft drink, no booze. Called ‘Apple Beer.’ Think it’s a Mormon thing. They make it down in Utah, and our distributor’s carryin’ it now. Since you don’t drink, I need to know what guys like you’ll go for. Watch what it does." He started to pour it into the glass, where it created a tall head matching the form and color of a freshly poured draft of beer.</p>
<p>The words, “guys like you” stung. My father had said that when he threw me out. The psychologist said that when he pushed for shock treatments. I’m always the other.</p>
<p>I took the glass and drank from it: sort of a sparkling apple juice flavor, very slightly bitter. Clearly, it contained no alcohol, and I doubted it actually contained apple either, a sort of artificial aftertaste. "It's the Miller Lite of root beer. I'd drink it; it's a decent deception."</p>
<p>"I'll buy a case." He turned and strode out of the room without another word.</p>
<p>Chris laughed. "I told you, the thunderstorm is over. Enjoy the sunshine, keep your sunscreen handy."</p>
<h2 id="LateAfternoon">Late Afternoon</h2>
<p>For the next half hour, I bounced around the bar with nothing to do. I played pinball and considered going into the card room as a player. Instead, Dolph, tending the bar, told me that Vince wanted to see me in the office. I knocked at the locked office door, and Judy opened it.  Vince sat at a desk against the far wall, opposite the cashier window. As I walked in, he turned in his chair to face me. "It's 3:30. Doubt you wanna spend the day playin’ pinball, and I sure as hell don’t want you in the card room hustlin’ my players.” Had he read my mind?  “You wanna spend the rest of the day ridin’?”</p>
<p>"Yeah, I would. This morning's ride was short, and the weather's so perfect today."</p>
<p>"Good. I got a job for you. Need you to run a package."</p>
<p>"A package?" I felt trepidation sweep up my body. "Where to?"</p>
<p>“Cherry, one of our brothers, that's his club name, his name's Larry..."</p>
<p>Club name? Do they have secret passwords to get into the club treehouse, too?</p>
<p>"...he lives down on Finley Point, east side of the lake. I’ll give you the address, lay out the directions. You take it straight to his door.”</p>
<p>My fear of Vince peaked again. He turned around and plucked a box about ten by six by three inches from his desk and handed it to me. Made of heavy-duty cardboard and completely sealed, it weighed about five pounds.</p>
<p>"Umm, can I ask what's in the package?"</p>
<p>He didn't answer. He turned back to his desk and started writing. I stood there in silence, my mind racing trying to figure out how much a brick of cocaine might weigh. I had no clue.</p>
<p>He handed me a sheet with a name, address, and some turn-by-turn directions. “Takes about an hour to get there. Roads on Finley Point ain’t well marked, lotta forks. Follow the directions. This box goes to Larry. He’s expectin’ it. You hand it to him, no one else.”</p>
<p>"What if he's not there?"</p>
<p>"He'll be there."</p>
<p>"Say something goes wrong, do I bring it back to you?"</p>
<p>“Nothin’s gonna fuckin' go wrong. Yeah, just bring it back if there’s a problem. Don’t leave it sittin’ anywhere. If you gotta eat, do it after the drop.”</p>
<p>“OK." I felt no reassurance from anything he said.</p>
<p>“Me and Chris will cut out early tonight, prob’ly ‘round eight. Sunday nights are slow, but that’ll change in a couple weeks. Get back before then, and the three of us’ll grab dinner.”</p>
<p>“OK."</p>
<p>“You got four hours, go have some fun. Get a feel for that bike before we ride the Park tomorrow.” Vince turned back to his desk, dismissing me.</p>
<p>I carried the box out to the Sportster as if it were radioactive. I dropped it in the saddle bag. I looked at the directions Vince gave me, committed them to memory, and took off back down MT35 for the third time in twenty-four hours.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0275" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I got to Flathead Lake at the town of Big Fork.  The lake is huge, nearly thirty miles long and fifteen miles wide. A fossil left behind by the Pleistocene glaciation, this was where the southernmost extent of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet died. Sacred to the Salish and the Kootenai people, the south half of the lake lies within the Flathead Indian Reservation.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0276" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>MT35 was a slow shoulderless road wedged between the eastern lake shore and the western face of the Mission Mountains. Few roads intersect eastbound, mostly just a steep grade to wilderness. The shoreline side, dirt roads and driveways intersect with the highway every hundred yards for nearly the entire thirty-mile length. While there are some good curves, they're shackled by the turning traffic and the forty-mile-per-hour speed limit. It took more than an hour to get to Finley Point Road.</p>
<p>I turned westward onto the Finley Point peninsula with a clear view of the western sky. A dark thunderstorm crowded the horizon, looming menacingly over the lake.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0278" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The forks and turns were not so bad, but the occasionally deep gravel made two-wheeled travel treacherous. I made only one navigation error. My bad turn detoured to a road that rejoined my intended path in less than a quarter mile, so no harm, no foul.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0279" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I soon rolled up a dirt driveway to a single wide manufactured home tucked into the forest next to a huge cherry orchard. The trees, crowded with fruit, looked ready for harvest. A couple of young children darted out of the house to watch me pull in. I stopped, flipped the side stand down, leaned the bike onto it, and dismounted. I heard a roll of distant thunder.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0280" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Looking to the kids, I called out, "Is Larry here?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0281" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>They just stared at me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0282" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Then a voice came from the orchard, "I'm Larry."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0283" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned as a shirtless man in overalls and work boots emerged from the trees. Bearded, muscular with a few tattoos, he had calloused hands stained by cherries. Amused, I noticed the classic slot machine twin cherries tattooed on his chest.</p>
<p>I called out, "I've got a package for you from Vince."</p>
<p>"Yeah! That's the one. Been waitin’ on this box for a month.” He trotted toward me with a smile.</p>
<p>Another roll of thunder barreled through from the west, but this time, it reverberated off the mountains to the east, giving an odd stereo delay effect. A wind started rustling the leaves in the orchard.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0287" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pulled out the box from the saddlebag and handed the box off to him. He tucked it under his left arm and offered his right hand to me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0288" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shook his hand in, yet again, that biker handshake. "I’m Karl."</p>
<p>“So, uh… Karl, how’d you come to be ridin' Acid’s bike? That's Acid's steel.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0290" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Acid?" I blinked, paused—how was that even a name? "Vince gave me this bike to ride today. I'm a new dealer at the Iron Horse."</p>
<p>"Vince did. Huh. That's somethin'."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0292" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A bright flash of lightning to the north and an instant blast of thunder made us both flinch. The kids vanished into the house.  "No rain... come on, not now, not today. No rain." Larry tipped his face skyward in supplication.</p>
<p>As if in contempt, a few fat drops started spattering around on the gravel.</p>
<p>"Shit," Larry muttered. "We better get under the roof. It's gonna dump."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0295" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He jogged to the garage and lifted the door one-handed. Two bikes sat inside: a large traveling bagger, and a chopper on a stand with its primary case open.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0296" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Roll Acid's bike in. Radio this morning said hail might be commin'"</p>
<p>I walked around the Sportster, kicked it into neutral, and pushed it under the awning.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0298" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Larry just stood there looking at his orchard as the rain drops fell faster and faster. He took a deep breath and release a long sigh. "It's in the devil’s hands now. Goddamn it all to hell."</p>
<p>"What's the problem?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0300" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Just started harvesting. Got twen'y acres of Bings out there. Perfect Bings. This rain... well, they soak it up and start swellin'. They split wide open. Cuts the price in half at the dock in Kalispell.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0301" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Another flash and immediate thunder cut off his words. In echo, thirty seconds of the hard rain danced over the orchard in sheets. Leaves fell, beaten off by the downpour. Just as it started, it stopped as if a spigot had turned off. The wind  reversed directions and the rain returned, soaking, but with a little less fury.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0302" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Another flash of lightning, but this time the thunder sounded several seconds after it, coming from the north. The rain slacked off and then stopped again. We stood and watched in silence for several minutes as the thunder, rain, and wind pelted the orchard on and off, over and over.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0303" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Larry stared out at the mountain wall to the east as if he couldn't bear watching the orchard any more. "Sometimes a storm'll hit the mountain and just park there. Other times, it'll bounce off, roll north ‘round the end of the Missions at Big Fork into the Swan." He gestured toward the southern Missions, "Never head south. Mountains get taller that way, blocks 'em up, I guess."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0304" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The next roll of thunder came from even further to the north, while the wind settled into a consistent southbound breeze. "That there's outflow. Good sign. Well... good for me, anyway. Not so much for the growers up along the shore north. They're gonna get the worst of it now."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0305" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>In just a few minutes, the sun began stabbing through the scud clouds. Larry lightened up, too, declaring the storm ended. "Alright, that wasn’t so bad. Coulda been worse. No hail... Fuckin' lucky."</p>
<p>"Sorry you had that stress. Agriculture is always a crap shoot," I commented.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0307" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You got that right. My grandad started this orchard years ago.”  He stepped back from the garage apron and set his package on a workbench. Pulling a knife from his pocket, he deftly sliced the end of the box open and dumped out the contents. A shiny hardened steel primary chain clanked onto the bench top.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0308" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He lifted it with one hand. "Yeah. That's the one. That's perfect." He looked over to me. “This is for the chopper I'm fixin' up. Didn’t have the cash, but, uh… Vince said he’d find one. That's the thing about him. The man says he's gonna do somethin', he does it. Simple as that.”</p>
<p>"Yeah, he seems like a really nice guy," Keeping deadpan, I thought about this new fear of Vince—why's he fucking with me like this?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0310" style="color: #7b5400;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Larry looked at me with one eyebrow down. "So… who  are you? You ain’t a brother. Don’t sound like you know Carnie..." He stopped for a beat and looked at me hard. "You don't know Vince very good.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0311" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I explained that I had just met Vince and Chris last night at the Iron Horse and how they hired me to deal cards for the Sturgis rush.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0312" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Huh. I trust the man, I do. But I ain’t never seen him loan a brother's iron to an outsider. Not once. ‘Course, Acid won't be back for it anytime soon. Not for a long time."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0313" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He fixed me with hard stare. "Good to have a club President always thinkin’ a step ahead. Either you got somethin’ he wants, or you can do somethin’ he can’t.”</p>
<p>"Okay, this is creeping me out. I've known him for less than a day, I think I'm missing a shitload of information here." I hoped he'd enlighten me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0315" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You ridin’ this bike tells me he’s got a wager on you. Bet you’ll be a prospect by the end of summer."</p>
<p>"Prospect?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0317" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"It's the first step to joinin'. Like a try-before-you-buy. All the brothers had to go through it. We were all prospects once."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0318" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I felt my brow furrow. "Vince told me to bring this box to you, but wouldn't tell me that it was in it. I spent the last hour on the highway worrying that he conned me into being a drug mule."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0319" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"He wouldn't do that. Nah, just the primary chain." He looked to his front door. "I don't bring drugs anywhere near my girls or the house." He turned back to me with a challenge. "So... you didn't even know what you had, but you rode it down here anyway? That's what you're tellin' me?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0320" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Silence. I didn't have an answer.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0321" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He grinned. "Hard man to refuse, ain't he? Makes him a good leader."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0322" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Carn... Vince is the President. We do what he tells us. You wanna answers like why, you gotta ask him.” He looked back to the house. "You want a beer?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0323" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No, thanks. Can I get some water, though?" My water bottle was still with the Honda.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0324" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Sure thing." He walked to the house as the clouds broke completely and the sun returned. The temperature, having dropped during the rain, regained the upper hand, quickly returning to and then likely exceeding the previous high. Tiny wisps of water vapor curled around each other all over the gravel driveway.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0325" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I walked over to the workbench and looked into the box to see if anything else was in there. Only found a piece of paper, a manufacturer’s packing list.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0326" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Larry came back out, a beer in one hand and a glass of water in the other. His two kids peeked out from behind the door, watching us. He handed me the glass, while taking a long draw on his beer can.</p>
<p>I drained my glass quickly. "I'll get back on the highway, so you can get back to your orchard."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0328" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Nothin’ to be done. Least an hour before I get back to work. Can’t pick ‘em wet. They’d start moldin’ second they're piled in the crates. If it stays dry, we’ll get a few more hours in ‘til dark. Gotta let ‘em dry first. That’s the trick."</p>
<p>"You're doing this yourself?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0330" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Oh, hell no. Got a crew workin’ the far side out by the road. Mexicans. Hard workers. No way in hell we’d get the harvest in without ‘em. Gonna pull a hundred tons out of that orchard this year."</p>
<p>We had a few moments in silence. “What happened to the club in Missoula in ‘76?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0332" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Larry just looked at me for a few moments, his expression melting to melancholy. “Half the club ended up dead or locked up that year." He got a lot quieter, like a blanket fell onto the garage and muffled his voice. "Used to be around eighty of us. Back then, George was in charge. One of the original founders outta Butte, way back in ‘49."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0333" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He stepped over to his torn down chopper and knelt down to examine the exposed dry primary. "George got it in his head that we could run the horse and coke trade in the university towns and on the northern reservations. Old bastards didn't know what the fuck they were doin'. Uh, Vince said they turned their backs on what we stood for. Betrayed the oath. The club split right then and there.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0334" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“He stood him down. George pulled his crew tight down in Butte and Missoula, and we kept outta their way up here by the lake. About six months later, George thought he made it. He got a supply deal lined up with the Ghost River Clan outta California."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0335" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He stood up and turned to face me again. "Only it wasn’t the Ghosts. It was the Feds. DEA, FBI, BIA..., all in on it with the Montana Highway Patrol."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0336" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He took a deep breath. "Turned into a goddamn battle. Five brothers died." He shook his head. "George rotted in some federal prison down in Texas ‘til he died a couple years back. Rest of ‘em scattered through the Fed system. Few still sittin’ in Deer Lodge on state time."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0337" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He pointed to the Sportster. "Acid's locked up in Deer Lodge."</p>
<p>I thought of all those bikes in Vince's garage. "How did Vince and the rest of you not go down with everyone else?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0339" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He stepped out to the edge of garage apron and looked out at his orchard. “He saved all of us up here by the lake. They arrested him. They still thought he was George's right hand man, figured they had the whole tree by the roots."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0340" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>His voice turned reverent. "They couldn't make nothin’ stick. Man’s a bookkeeper. Truth be told, I think his wife does that. Every damn record and receipt in order. Not even the tax man could find a crack. Walked out free. Dismissed, no trial, no nothin’."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0341" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>His eyes lost focus as if he was looking at something farther away than his cherries. "Half the guys who didn’t end up inside, packed up, moved their families clear outta state to get away from the stink of it."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0342" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He tapped the side of his head with a cherry stained finger while turning back into the garage. "Vince's a smart one. He kept a clean shop. Stuck with our charter to support each other.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0343" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I focused in, making sure I had eye contact. "So Vince is above board?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0344" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He shrugged. “Not for me to say. I stay in my own lane. Hell, though, he’s a member of the Flathead County Chamber of Commerce, for Christ’s sake. They run the valley’s Toys for Tots drive. Him and Sarah helped start the local food bank a couple years back.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0345" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“How many members are there?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0346" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"‘Bout thirty, mostly in Lake and Flathead counties. Rook's down in Missoula, think he's the last one down there.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0347" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Wait. Rook in Missoula? That's the name of the biker bar on Front Street."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0348" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Larry nodded. "Yeah, that's his tavern. You been there?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0349" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I nodded, thinking back to a distressing evening where I ended up alone on the riverbank beating myself up for being turned on by a bartender. Was that Rook?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0350" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Back by the pool tables. There's all those old photo portraits on the walls. Acid's picture’s all the way in the back."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0351" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shrugged.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0352" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Well, you'd remember if you'd seen it. His eyes, nobody forgets his eyes." Larry grinned. "He did those flames on the tank himself. He was an artist with a spray gun." He crouched down to examine the IronHead's tank.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0353" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Couldn't stop the wince, my hand went straight to my face. I turned away from Larry toward the orchard. Those eyes from the television drilled into me from all those years ago. My dick stirred—unwelcome timing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0354" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He continued from behind me. "They said he had a public defender that wasn't worth a damn. Deer Lodge is a hell of a price for the wrong place at the wrong time."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0355" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I composed my face and turned back.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0356" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He tapped the tank. "This was a month old when they grabbed him. Barely got to ride it. It'll be antique by the time he's out.”</p>
<p>I shut my eyes for a moment, overwhelmed by my situation and then coming to a decision.</p>
<p>“OK, it stopped raining, I'm going to head back to Columbia Falls. Thank you for answering my questions." I walked straight over to the bike with the intent of leaving immediately.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0359" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Wait a minute, I got somethin' for you to take back." He jogged back to the house. The kids ducked back inside again.</p>
<p>I pushed the bike back out onto the damp gravel of the driveway.</p>
<p>In just a few moments, he came out with a brown paper Polson IGA grocery bag. "Take these up to Vince and Sarah."</p>
<p>"Do I get to know what's in this bag? Or is this another blind drop?" I couldn't keep the sarcasm and agitation out of my voice.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0363" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"It's just cherries." He opened the bag for me to peer in. I grunted an assent and opened the right saddle bag to put them in.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0364" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Nope, put 'em on the left side. They'll cook sitting over the pipes."</p>
<p>I shook my head, grateful that he pointed that out, but wondering if it meant my head was too twisted up to ride. I re-stowed them into the left saddle bag and mounted the bike.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0366" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Have good harvest." I abruptly started the bike, popped the clutch, and flew down the wet gravel back to the highway.</p>
<h2 id="EarlyEvening">Early Evening</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0368" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Once out from the tree cover, I spotted the thunderstorm squatting over the highway between me and Columbia Falls. I didn't want to ride into that, but the western horizon showed clear sky. I turned south with the intent of circling around the south side of the lake through Polson and then back up north along the west side on US93.</p>
<p>I couldn't expel that image of Acid and his haunted wild eyes from my mind. All this shit of the last thirty-two hours crowded my head with too many thoughts, worries, speculation, and, worst of all, fear. I pulled my focus onto staying alive on the highway, banking the wind would clear my head.</p>
<p>Forty minutes later, I rounded the ridge that opens the view of Big Arm, the lake's largest bay, jutting five miles westward from the main body. Chief Cliff lords over the view standing high on the northside, an unexpected two hundred-foot rampart halfway down an otherwise unremarkable ridge line. It's an odd geologic feature, created by a sharp turn of a meltwater river on the western margin of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet thousands of years ago. With the eastern half of the riverbed made from ice and the western half from rock, the retreat of the glacier stranded the cliff and only half of a riverbed a thousand feet above the modern valley floor.</p>
<p>Another memory from high school surfaced in my mind. We had spent a few weeks studying Montana History from the Indians’ point of view. We learned several tales from the local Salish and Kootenai tribes, from their creation myths to their tragic recent histories. One of those stories specifically pertained to Chief Cliff over Flathead Lake: the tragedy of Chief Æneas, a leader of the Kootenai people in the late 1800s.</p>
<p>After witnessing the hanging of four young men of his tribe in front of the Missoula County Court House, he became despondent with grief for his oppressed people. He rode to the top of Chief Cliff to address his tribe camped below. He spoke of the indignity of their current state of life. He mourned the loss of bravery, tradition, and worst of all, wisdom from the younger generation. Then, in a rage, he kicked his horse into a gallop and plummeted off the cliff. Both he and his horse died on the rocks below. With his death came the death of the tribe's way of life. Defeated, they consented to confinement on their reservation. They say his words still whisper from the cliff today.</p>
<p>I watched Chief Cliff for the next quarter hour while my perspective shifted as the highway swung out to the end of Big Arm in the west and then folded back to the east following the shoreline of the lake's main body. I thought of the old chief of the Kootenai and his echoing grief. My thoughts turned to Vince, apparently the leader of a small tribe of his own, trying to hold his people together in the shadow of the tragic destruction of his brothers. Vince took a decidedly different path than Chief Æneas.</p>
<p>I came to no conclusions, but continued on up US93 in the wind on a bike that was not mine to ride.</p>
<p>I pulled up to the Iron Horse around seven thirty. A dozen big baggers, both Harleys and Honda Gold Wings, lined the front of the building. Tourists on vacation. I pulled the cherry sack from the saddlebag and strode into the building. Vince looked up from behind the bar as I stomped in. He smiled at me. I dropped the bag on the bar and sat heavily on a bar stool. I said nothing; I just looked at Vince standing there.</p>
<p>He returned my gaze for a moment. "You okay?"</p>
<p>"Don't know what I am."</p>
<p>"I'd offer you a drink. You look like you need one, but don't think you'd take it."</p>
<p>"I need to eat and I want to smoke a joint."</p>
<p>He looked around at the clock and then turned back. “Can you hang tight for twenty? We’re headin’ out ‘round eight.”</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>Vince looked into the bag and laughed, "Damn. Shoulda figured what was in the bag."</p>
<p>I abruptly got up, walked over to an unoccupied table over by the pool tables, and plopped down onto a chair facing away from the bar. After a few minutes, I braced my elbows on the table and leaned my forehead onto my hands. I spent the next twenty minutes staring at the tabletop: exhausted, confused, scared, and profoundly sad.</p>
<p>Eventually, the sound of someone setting a plate in front of me knocked me out of my sullen rumination. I lifted my head; Chris stood by the table holding a plate of his own. "Can we join you here at your table?"</p>
<p>I looked at him for a moment, clearing my head. I nodded, but said nothing.</p>
<p>He set his plate down, pulled the chair out, and sat down. "Are you okay?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0387" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shrugged, though the smell of the burger and fries in front of me  aroused my hunger. Vince's tattooed arm entered my field of view from the left and set a pint of what I assumed was that Apple Beer next to my plate. I looked up at him as he set his own plate on the table and he sat down opposite Chris.</p>
<p>My body commanded me to eat. I pulled the plate closer and started to eat. Soon, my ravenous hunger took over, my focus shifted solely to eating, blocking everything else. I said nothing and did not look up until I had cleared the plate.</p>
<p>I glanced alternately between Vince and Chris. "Thank you. I really needed to eat." Neither of them had gotten even more than a few bites into their meal. They both looked at me, clearly telegraphing concern with their expressions.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0390" style="color: #8b5e00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I felt obliged to explain myself. I took a deep breath, let it out and started. "I live alone. I've lived by myself for two years. Last winter, I went an entire month without ever even seeing another person. I spend my time hiking or skiing in the forest or along the train tracks by myself. The last, what is it, thirty-six hours has flipped the table on my life. I'm overwhelmed. I'm not handling it. So much of what I've dreamed for is in front of me, and I want to grab it. But the closer I look, I see it’s all filled with fishhooks. I want desperately to bite, but it's all fucking fishhooks."</p>
<p>"I hear ya, brother," Vince said quietly.</p>
<p>"'Brother'? Don't call me that. It’s just another fishhook." I instantly regretted saying it. I desperately wanted to be his brother. I wanted him to accept me, but the price—how can I afford the price? That brought me to ultimate conclusion. I didn’t really have any other choice.</p>
<p>"We need to talk. Can't do it here. You up for ridin' back up to the house?"</p>
<p>"I want my own bike back."</p>
<p>"No problem. We’ll just swap 'em here."</p>
<p>I drank the Apple Beer while Vince and Chris finished their meals.</p>
<h2 id="Dusk">Dusk</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0398" style="color: #624500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>———> rewrite CUT111</p>
<p><b><span id="U0399" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>———> The entire segment must be shortened, it's too dense, covers waaay more ground than it needs to. Spread it out, man.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0400" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>On the ride back to their house on the Honda, they flanked me: Vince ahead, Chris behind. I struggled not to just peel off, turn around, and hightail back home on the other side of the Continental Divide.  Would they chase me down?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0401" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I just wanted to be alone in the forest.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0402" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>So close to running. I knew I'd regret it, backed off. Over and over, the feeling would build again, seconds from peeling away, but then I'd reconsider.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0403" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Maybe this is the only opportunity I'll ever get. The sex—how could I ride away from that?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0404" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I declined to put my bike in their garage. I parked in front, repositioned to face the road, poised for fast escape. Just in case. My strategic parking didn’t go unnoticed. Vince silently watched me set up my escape plan.</p>
<p>We walked into the house through the mudroom and kitchen. The silent house now seemed ominous rather than warm and welcoming. "Where's Sarah?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0406" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"She’s runnin’ the Horse. She was behind the bar when we walked out." Chris looked at me like I was nuts. "Jesus, she even said ‘hello’ to you."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0407" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shook my head. "Sorry. Stressed out."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0408" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris put his hand on my shoulder for a moment. "S'okay, man. Let's get you that joint you wanted."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0409" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Can we sit outside somewhere?" All the dark corners leered at me. "I don't want to be in here. I need to be under the sky."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0410" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince nodded and move toward the door at the other end of the kitchen. “Yeah, c’mon. Hit the patio.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0411" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Meet you there," Chris said over his shoulder as he disappeared  down a hallway.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0412" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We walked into their Sunset Magazine showcase of a patio facing the ski slopes of Big Mountain: flagstones, rimmed firepit, and heavy stone table large enough to seat a dozen. A scattering of chairs, lounges, and potted plants balanced scene. An inviting net hammock hung between two lodgepole pines just off the flagstone edge.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0413" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>These guys had money. No way the bar could be this profitable.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0414" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I looked up to the sky with a heavy sigh. The midsummer sun had set a half hour earlier, still in twilight, no stars showing yet.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0415" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince took the seat at the end of the table, I took a seat near him on his right. We sat in silence until Chris appeared with tray of beers and a green pear shaped bottle of some imported sparkling water. He sat opposite me after distributed the drinks. He pulled a joint and a lighter out of his breast pocket and offered it to me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0416" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris spoke up like he needed to break the icy silence. “Didn’t figure you for not likin’ the Sporty.” He watched me light the joint as if monitoring my health.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0417" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I took my hit, held it, and blew my lungful of smoke up at the sky. “I loved it." With a shake of my head, I said, "Just can’t do it. It's not mine to ride." I passed the joint back to Chris.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0418" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We sat in silence until I felt the obligation to fill it. "I need to get who you guys are. Back in high school, I remember seeing the TV reports about a big trial at the courthouse. Members of a biker gang, your Bitterroot Bastards." I sat silent giving them a chance to speak up.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0419" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince scowled and gave a low grunt of disapproval.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0420" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris released his lungful and passed the joint to Vince.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0421" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Without their comment, I continued, "Drug trafficking, weapons, racketeering, and murder." I focused my eyes directly on Vince. He shook his head hard, I pushed on. "This afternoon, you sent me down the valley with a package. I figured I was your new virgin drug mule. Then Larry, or what the fuck... Cherry, explained to me that you're the good guy. Then I find out I've spent the day a bike owned by a guy in prison named Acid. This is too much."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0422" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince blew a cloud down the table and passed the joint back to me. “Listen, that's not us. And Acid ain’t no murderer. His name's Sid. He's an idiot, but didn't deserve what he got..."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0423" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I jumped in while coughing the smoke of my hit. "That just fucking doesn't matter. I learned that the Bitterroot Bastards were a dangerous, violent, and lawless gang of drug pushers. And now, all of a sudden, they're supposedly not that, I'm riding with you, and I've agreed to deal cards at your bar."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0424" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince tapped the air with his right hand at me. "Calm down. We’re a club of brothers banded together for freedom. This country’s got a real hard-on for tellin’ guys like us what we can and can’t do."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0425" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Interrupting again, I said, "Holy shit, is it that fucking Sovereign Citizen bullshit?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0426" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He shook his head hard. "Hell no, we ain’t that fairytale crap. But, yeah, we got some of that same fire in us. "</p>
<p><b><span id="U0427" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He put a fist down on the table. "You said it yourself last night, you’re a criminal ‘cause you’re gay. You broke the law this morning just layin’ in bed with us. You smoke pot that’s another one. Felony. You sell yourself to a buddy, take his load as a favor? Hell, now you’re a goddamn prostitute. Another felony."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0428" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>That hit me hard, my future, bleak as it was, just seemed to crumple ahead of me. I passed the joint back to Chris.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0429" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince's voice got louder, like the water just hitting a rolling boil. "Just livin’ how you wanna live makes you an outlaw in Montana. The Bastards ain’t about playin’ by their rules. We’re about watchin’ each other’s backs and takin’ what’s ours in a rigged game."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0430" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I muttered, "stacked deck."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0431" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Chris exhaled his hit. "Exactly." He passed the joint to Vince.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0432" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Vince accepted it, but just held onto it. "We're not the guys you saw on the news. We're the survivors. We split from George before any of that crap. We kept to the real Club Charter."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0433" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>———> need a new bridge here. Vince needs to say something really stupid here to set Karl off.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0434" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>———> Original location of CUT117</p>
<p><b><span id="U0435" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Is that what a brother means to you? Is that what it means to your club?"</p>
<p>Vince looked stunned but said nothing. He dropped the joint on the table.</p>
<p>Chris sat frowning at Vince and then spoke up, "Truth to power, Vince. Pretty sure you said damn near the exact same thing to George about ten years back.”</p>
<p>He whispered my words back, "Is that what brother means?" Chris clearly hit the nerve. "Goddamn it… I fucked this up," He stood up, turned, and stalked back into the house without another word.</p>
<p>"Give him a few minutes. He fucked up. You didn't." Chris reached over, picked up the joint, "This is toasted. One joint is never enough for three people. I got another one." He dropped the roach into the ashtray on the table and pulled another joint from his little wooden box. He held it in his lips and flicked the lighter, a blinding flash in the growing darkness. He held the joint out to me, but I didn't take it.</p>
<p>"Should I just leave now?" I thought of my bike poised for my escape.</p>
<p>“Hell no. You just showed exactly Vince exactly what he wants to see. He just wasn’t expectin’ it pointed at him. He’ll get over it. Now, here, take the damn joint.”</p>
<p>I took it, but it was already out. I flicked the lighter, blinded myself with it, and I took my hit.</p>
<p>“Ain’t the first time you’ve shown guts. Last night at the table, even while you were playin’ the scared chump, you shut Sheila down cold with just three words. Remember? She called out your earring, said it was a lady’s, and you didn’t even blink before firing back...”</p>
<p>I interrupted, ”yeah, I said it’s mine.”</p>
<p>“Man, that was perfect. I damn near droped the deck. That’s when I really started watchin’ you. Figured you weren’t exactly what you were sellin’. Same as just now with Vince,  you staked your claim, stood your ground. Full-on defiance, no hesitation. That's guts.”</p>
<p>It was getting too dark to see Chris, so I leaned my head back in the chair and started to watch the sky. I spotted Vega immediately, as it was always one of the first stars of the night sky.</p>
<p>“Man, we had such a damn good time with you this morning, I forgot we only just met. Didn’t realize all you knew was the worst of the club. Hell, didn’t figure you knew anything about us at all.”</p>
<p>Chris continued, “That tarot mess this afternoon. Yeah, he blew up at you, but trust me. Vince likes you. He ain’t the type to just randomly invite someone into our bed..."</p>
<p>We heard the door, and Vince walked back to the table. Chris kept talking, saying loudly enough for Vince to hear, "...’Cause Vince here’s still workin’ through some serious mother issues."</p>
<p>I looked to Vince as he sat down to see his reaction, but it had gotten too dark. I could not see his face well enough to gauge his expression. There wouldn't be a moon tonight as the waning crescent would only rise an hour before the sun.</p>
<p>"Karl, I'm sorry. Been an ass today. Sarah called me on it after breakfast, said I was struttin’ around like some old peacock tryin’ to impress a new bird in the flock. She was right. She’s always right. Always will be. No excuse for it.”</p>
<p>I could clearly see the Summer Triangle in the sky: Vega, Altair, and Deneb. I knew this was the wrong way to have this conversation, not being able to see one another, but I needed to have my stars close to me tonight.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0453" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Far as my ma' goes, Mystic Mary was never much of one. Wouldn’t even let me call her ‘ma.’ Abusive, neglectful, vindictive as all hell. Been dead more’n twenty years, and she still messes with my head. I shouldn’t have blown up over it, wasn’t fair to you. No way you could’ve known tarot was a sore spot. That’s on me. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>I looked to the north and could pick out Polaris, but not yet the rest of Ursus Minor.</p>
<p>“And about that chain for Cherry, yeah, I'm an ass agin. That tarot thing fucked me up. After you took off, I called him, told him to answer whatever you asked. Guessin’ he filled you in on Acid and his ol'Sporty you’re ridin’.”</p>
<p>My eyes held to the sky, "Just told me I was on Acid's bike.  I asked about '76, and he told me the story. He had nothing but positive things to say about you. He credits you with saving all the club brothers in the two lake counties.”</p>
<p>I switched gears again without the clutch. “Larry also freaked me out this afternoon. He said he'd never seen you loan a brother's bike to someone outside the club. Larry thinks you got sort of plan for me. He said I should ask you about it.”</p>
<p>"Ain't got no plan for you, but I know what I want."</p>
<p>"And that is?"</p>
<p>“First off, business. I need help. Sturgis crowds are comin’ in, and we gotta get through the next four weeks. That’s where you come in. But as a friend? I wanna ride with you, get to know you. And yeah, I’ll admit it, I wanna fuck around with you again.</p>
<p>“You’re sharp, ain’t just about the cards. You program computers. Hell, I don’t think I’ve ever even seen a computer, let alone know what the fuck ‘programming’ means. But I do know we’re gonna need to understand ‘em sooner or later."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0462" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“I want you in the club. The ‘76 gutted us, took out all our leadership, nearly every member over forty, and a bunch of the younger ones, like Acid. Cherry’s the youngest we got now at thirty-five. I ain’t lettin’ the Bastards age out under me.”</p>
<p>I spoke up again with my wager. “Larry said he expected I would be a prospect by the end of the summer. That kind of makes it sound like I’m some sort of mining claim. Way too early even think about that. I'll deal cards for you, I need the money."</p>
<p>"That's fair." Vince let out a heavy sigh. “Ten years back, I had obligations I knew were bullshit. Took a loyalty oath, and the only thing I felt real obligation to was breakin’ it. I ain’t here to feed you no fishhooks.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” I said, "Chris told me earlier that your word is the law in the club. I think even benevolent dictators eventually fall."</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m the leader. Charter gives me the power, even lets me overrule the council. But what goddamn council? We don’t have enough brothers left to make one. Charter says we need a Council of Brothers, but let’s be real, we ain’t followed that thing in almost a decade.</p>
<p>“We’re stalled out. Need new blood, fresh ideas. Maybe that brain of yours can shake somethin’ loose. ‘Cause if not… we ain’t a club no more. Just a rained-out midway, waitin’ for someone t'kill the generator.”</p>
<p>"Your charter sounds so weirdly formal, like something out of another era, like the Odd Fellows, Moose Lodge, or that ripoff of Indian culture, the Improved Order of Red Men. Not exactly something that younger generations flock to. Tell me, do your brothers know you're gay and  with Chris?" I asked.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0469" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“I made it damn clear who Chris was when I agreed to lead. Couple guys didn’t like it, maybe that's why they tossed their patches. Truth is, they were already halfway out the door. Missoula spooked ‘em bad. Packed up their families, bailed. Heard Buck’s with the Ghost River Clan now, north of Tahoe. Rest of ‘em, don’t give a shit.</p>

<p>They laughed and I realized my fear of Vince and my trepidation had radiated away into the starry sky. The Milky Way spanned our narrow window to the sky through the trees. "There's a satellite," I called out, "straight up, it just passed Vega, the brightest star right above us, it's heading straight north."</p>
<p>I heard from Chris's side of the table, "Satellite? How can you see a satellite?"</p>
<p>"They're reflective metal, it's still in the sunlight. The sun hasn't set yet for it."</p>
<p>"It's an airplane” Vince sounded skeptical .</p>
<p>"Nope. No jets fly north across here, they're all east-west. Notice it’s not blinking?"</p>
<p>“Shit, you’re right. Spottin' satellites. That’s wild.”</p>
<p>"I don't see it," Chris wailed.</p>
<p>"It's about halfway to the trees, heading toward Polaris, the North Star."</p>
<p>"I still don't see. Oh, that star! It's moving! It's so fast. I never seen such a thing."</p>
<p>The three of us watched the sky and talked for the next hour. We saw one more satellite and a good north-to-south meteor, maybe an early Perseid.</p>
<p>Eventually, we all went inside and bedded down together. It took hours for me to fall asleep.</p>
