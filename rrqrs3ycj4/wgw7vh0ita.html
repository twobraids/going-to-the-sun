            <h2 id="RailroadCreekValley,Montana">Railroad Creek Valley, Montana</h2>
<p>I woke just after dawn on the day I was to have my first ride with David the biker. I quickly ate my breakfast. I ensured I had all my bike gear ready, just like I had done last night and just as I had done yesterday afternoon. I didn’t want anything to go wrong. I went out to the shed, needlessly checked the bike’s oil level, tire pressure, and gas level—again, just as I had done yesterday. Nothing spontaneously leaked or failed during the night.</p>
<p>I had ridden to the Amtrak station twice yesterday, timing it: only ten minutes to get to there from my cabin via the highway, US2. I had four hours to kill before the 10 a.m. rendezvous.</p>
<p>My typical morning walk up to the railroad tracks crosses the highway. Today, after walking down the gravel road to where it joined the asphalt of US2, I looked for signs of where I dumped the bike, a full two minutes into my very first ride in May. There was nothing to see. I had come so far in my riding since that first day only a month ago. I rode almost every day. Well, whenever the volatile spring weather allowed it.</p>
<p>I continued across the highway onto the sunken old highway grade that paralleled the new road eastward. After a quarter mile, I turned onto the gravel access road that climbed the bluff up to the railroad tracks. Hearing a low rumble, I sprinted up the last pitch as a set of green Burlington Northern engines thundered westward toward the top of Marias Pass. I approached the track as the engines' passing dropped the midblock signal from green to red a couple hundred yards up the grade. I stepped up to the edge of the ballast just to feel the rush of the car whipping only inches from me. Actually, they weren't moving very fast at all. The curve around this bluff was so tight that  the trains slowed practically to a walking pace.</p>
<p>Once the entire train passed, I stepped onto the tracks and followed it uphill. I walked for about a mile before I diverged onto an old, abandoned road leading back toward the highway. The bridge over Railroad Creek had decayed into just a few rotting wooden planks. The creek, in full flow from the spring snowmelt, roared below me, but I had good balance and crossed without much thought. I climbed back over the highway and into the forest on the other side. From there, a well-trodden game trail routed me back toward my cabin. I knew exactly where to split off so that I would arrive at my own back door. I knew every trail, every road, every view in this valley.</p>
<p>I had used only ninety minutes of my four-hour wait.</p>
<p>As the sun had not yet risen high enough to warm my cabin, I stoked my fire and sat down to read. I had acquired a book about the programming language called “C," dreaming that I would someday have access to a C compiler. I read and dreamed for the next hour and a half.</p>
<p>At 9:20, I got ready to leave. I changed into my riding clothes, not exactly regulation: my good jeans without the rips, my hiking boots, and the lighter pair of my skiing gloves. I put my backpacking water bottle in the bike's saddle bag along with some food, mostly backpacking trail mix. Overeagerly, I left the cabin at 9:35 and arrived at the Amtrak station in exactly ten minutes. I parked the bike and sat side-saddle on it, waiting for David to arrive.</p>
<h2 id="TheBlackfeetReservation,Montana">The Blackfeet Reservation, Montana</h2>
<p>Soon after arriving, a group of four Harleys emerged from the Glacier Park Hotel side of the railroad underpass. I watched them stop at US2, turn right to head up Marias Pass, and, I assumed, on to West Glacier. One of the bike passengers raised a hand to me, and I waved back.</p>
<p>The passenger train, Empire Builder, rolled in from the West, and I watched it disgorge a flock of tourists. In only a few minutes, the Amtrak train pulled out, resuming its eastbound journey.</p>
<p>A line of four bright Red Jammers, the Park’s vintage motor coaches, waited in front of the original log Great Northern Railway station. One at a time, each jammer pulled away from the station with an earsplitting grind of their elderly unsynchronized transmissions. Some looped around to the big hotel just a hundred yards across the road while others headed North to the sister hotel at Many Glacier.</p>
<p>I sighed as ten o'clock came and went.</p>
<p>Another westbound Burlington Northern freight pass by the station without slowing.  Not long afterwards, one rumbled by the other way.</p>
<p>At 10:30, I could only call myself crestfallen. I mentally kicked myself for getting so wound up for this failed rendezvous. How could I ever have been so naïve to have expected this fantasy to actually come true? I got up, opened a saddle bag, took a long drag from my water bottle, and ate a handful of my trail mix.</p>
<p>I decided to just go do the ride alone: just as always in everything, by myself. I leaned over and stowed my water bottle. As I shut the saddle bag, I heard the telltale syncopated rhythm of Harley pipes. I whipped around to the south and saw David cross over the centerline of US2 and onto the gravel where I waited. My heart leapt from the depths to the heights in a matter of two seconds. I let out a long sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"Howdy," David called over the noise of his bike. He parked, dismounted, and proffered his hand. Surprised, I reached for his hand, but instead of clasping, he grabbed onto my wrist. Totally confused, I looked up to him, met his eyes, and he made a downward gesture with his head. I realized that I was supposed to grab his wrist. I did so, there was a single shake, and he let go. “That’s how you check if the other guy’s got a blade up his sleeve.” I think I just got a first lesson in biker culture.</p>
<p>"You ready to ride?" I nodded.  “We’ll take Two Medicine Road at the underpass, cut over to 49, then 89 up to Many Glacier for lunch. After that, 464 down to Browning, US2 to Cut Bank, then 358—” he gave me a sideways glance. “You ride gravel?”</p>
<p>"Only my road up to my cabin."</p>
<p>“We’ll see how you feel about Mollies Nipple Road.” He smirked. “Could take it all the way down to Valier, but Molly’s Nipple’s a helluva lot more fun.” He shrugged. “Either way, we’ll drop down to Dupuyer, then cut back up to Heart Butte. You got all that?”</p>
<p>"I'll follow."</p>
<p>David followed on with instructions on how to ride with another motorcycle. Under no circumstances was I to try to ride beside him. He wanted me always at least ten car lengths behind him. I agreed to his rules.</p>
<p>We took off into the joy of the wind.</p>
<p>Highway 49 was just as much fun as it had been the previous week. However, it became apparent that the Harley was not as nimble as my little Honda. I kept creeping up on him in the curves and had to keep very mindful of hanging back.</p>
<p>At the town of Babb, near the Many Glacier cut-off, he stopped at a roadside tavern. There were about a dozen other bikes, a mixture of Harleys, BMW boxers, and those giant Honda Goldwings. We had our lunch there. David had three beers with his burger.</p>
<p>He looked downright offended that I wouldn’t drink. The second time I turned down his offer of a beer, he narrowed his eyes and threw it right at me. “What, you too good for a drink? Thought you rode, kid.”</p>
<p>He gestured out the window toward the parking lot as if it were obvious. “This is what these machines are for. Harley straight-up calls 'em ‘bar hoppers.’” He sneered. “Oh yeah, forgot—you’re on that Jap junk. Guess you ought to be sippin’ sake over a bowl of ramen instead.”</p>
<p>I didn't look at him, feeling resentment at his shaming. I was puzzled how he could drink so much, but not really show any signs of getting drunk. I concluded that he just handled it really well. I had never met anyone that could drink like that. Alcohol has never been my drug of choice. I can’t handle it at all. It just makes me feel sick and clumsy. Riding the bike with alcohol in my system would quickly kill me.</p>
<p>I eventually got frustrated with David’s riding style. Did we really have to stop at every damn bar on the route? David drank beer constantly. We stopped in both Browning and Cut Bank. In both places, the bartender knew David by name.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After Cut Bank, heading down 358, I saw a sign for Mollies Nipple Road pass by. Either David had forgotten about it, or passing it meant he cast a vote of no confidence on my riding. I sighed heavily—disappointed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>———> rewrite CUT148</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>In mid-afternoon, he pulled into a tavern in the town of Duyper. I followed him in. We sat at the bar. He ordered beer. I ordered 7-up. He gave me the side eye.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After some silence, he set is beer down and turned his eyes at me. "Are you a free man?"</p>
<p>"Most people don’t got a fuckin’ clue, but the so-called ‘government’? Total fraud. Not what the Founding Fathers created.”</p>
<p>"Well, yeah, I think things have gotten kind of twisted over the last 200 years. It galls me that Reagan, a fuckin' Hollywood actor, is in the White House." I wondered where he was going with this.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“It’s way deeper than that.” He leaned in, voice low like he was letting me in on some great secret. “Back in the 1800s, they flipped the whole damn system, turned the Federal government into a corporation. A real, actual business. We ain’t citizens of a country anymore, we’re assets. Property."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He jabbed a finger on the bar for emphasis. “All them laws, taxes, licenses? Total bullshit. Just wayso keep us under their boot. How’d they drag my ass to ‘Nam? Slavery, plain and simple. They claim to own us, like we’re just numbers in their system, and we’re supposed to jump when they say to.”</p>
<p>I added, "Carter restarted the Selective Service in 1980. I was in the first group that had to register. I certainly didn't feel like I had freedom,” I said mainly to appease him. I was wondering if he was about to morph the conversation into a pitch for Amway.</p>
<p>David shook his head, dead serious. “That’s just it. You signed, and that put you under their thumb. You entered a contract with the Federal Corporation. But here’s the thing—” he leaned in, “you did it under duress. And you can get out of it.”</p>
<p>"Yeah?" My interest piqued.</p>
<p>David’s eyes burned with conviction as he leaned in. “It’s called ‘withdrawin’ your consent.’ For your first step, you send ‘em a formal affidavit—straight up declare that you signed under duress, didn’t understand the nature of the so-called ‘contract,’ and that you’re takin’ back your sovereign status.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He smirked, like he took pride in knowing something I didn't. “Now, they ain’t gonna like it. Might push back, maybe even threaten you. But here’s the thing—they ain’t got lawful authority to force you into a contract you didn’t knowingly enter. Whole game’s about trickin’ folks into playin’ along. You just gotta stand firm, know the loopholes, and move through their bullshit system without givin’ ‘em your consent.”</p>
<p>This guy had no fucking clue about civic or legal structure. "So if this is true, how did you end up in Vietnam?"</p>
<p>David exhaled sharply, shaking his head like I was missing the obvious. “Same thing that you did, kid—I was young, signed somethin' I didn't understand while not knowin' my real rights. The ones the Founding Fathers laid down before the government twisted everything. They tricked me, same as everybody else.”</p>
<p>He leaned back, tilting his beer. “But I know better now. I don’t pay income tax—‘cause the Founders never set up no goddamn income tax. I don’t register my truck—‘cause they got zero authority under the Constitution to make me pay a fee just to travel. We’re all Sovereign Citizens—we just gotta wake up and start acting like it.”</p>
<p>"Wait a minute, you’ve got license plates on the back of your bike." I even knew the plate number—I'm always looking for patterns.</p>
<p>David exhaled hard, shaking his head. “Jesus, you are so goddamn like Derick. Got that plate off a wrecked scoot in a junkyard. Keeps the badge boys off my ass.”</p>
<p>He smirked. “Tribal cops don’t give a shit—I’m white, so they leave me alone. Sheriff’s boys and the highway patrol? They barely show their faces out on the rez. Long as I don’t give ‘em a reason, they don’t come sniffin’ around.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0050" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>———> end CUT148</p>
<p>Abruptly changing the subject, he just said, "Highway,” and gestured toward the exit. This cut off my question, “Who's Derick?”</p>
<p>We left the tavern, and remounted our bikes, and pointed back North up US89. Until this point in our ride, I had tagged along quite a distance behind him - this time, I shadowed him more closely. This guy got more and more intriguing with every crazy statement.</p>
<p>Just before getting to Heart Butte, he pulled over at a dirt road that wound up a hill to the West. I pulled in behind him and shut off the motor.</p>
<p>"I live up that way. You don’t wanna take that thing up there—you’d dump it in the first fifty yards. From here, you can head north until—"</p>
<p>"I know how to get home from here," I felt disappointed that he wasn't inviting me to his cabin.</p>
<p>“You can ride with me again next week." He spoke as if he granted a gift. "Heard they’re openin’ Going to the Sun this week."</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, conscious of being too eager.</p>
<p>“Same spot in East Glacier. Longer ride this time, so be there at nine.”</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll be there."</p>
<p>I watched him get back on the bike, and disappear up his road through the trees. I suddenly felt profoundly alone, but at the same time elated that I had this amazing privilege to tag along with this man.</p>
<p>I restarted my bike, rolled the throttle, pulled back on the road, and headed north. My mind swimming with a mix of emotions about this fascinating man. That tuft of dark chest hair that peeked out from his T-shirt, the hairy arms, what now looked like three weeks of beard growth, his constant ribbing me about my bike, his odd beliefs of what did he call himself? Sovereign Citizen?</p>
<p>Too much to think about. Soon, though, the curves of the road pushed the thoughts of my mind aside. I had to concentrate on the road, the bike, and my body, leaning into the twists, turns, dips, and ascents of the road winding through the hummocky glacially carved landscape.</p>
