<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I woke just after dawn on the day was to have my first ride with David the biker. Breakfast sat like a lump of plaster in my stomach. I ate too fast.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I ensured I had all my bike gear ready, just like I had done last night and just as I had done yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Can't let anything go wrong today.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I trudged out to the shed, checked the bike’s oil level, tire pressure, and gas level—again. Just like I had done yesterday. Nothing spontaneously leaked or failed during the night.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I timed the trip to the Amtrak station twice yesterday. Took only ten minutes from my cabin via US2.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I had four hours to kill before meeting David.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I hiked down the gravel road to where it joined the asphalt of US2. My typical morning walk up to the railroad tracks crossed the highway.  There was nothing to see. The asphalt betrayed nothing about my bike dumping humiliation last month—just our secret.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Since that day, most of my money had gone for gas. One tank, every single day, between a hundred seventy and two hundred miles. Not sustainable. Not enough money. Not enough paved roads on the Rez.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I waited for a car to pass, then sauntered across the highway.  The sunken old roadbed of the 1930s incarnation of US2 emerged from under the modern road halfway up the east hill. It made for a good hiking path through the growing mullein spikes away from the highway. After a quarter mile, I turned onto the gravel Burlington Northern maintenance road where it climbed the bluff to the railroad tracks.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Hearing a low rumble, I sprinted up the last pitch as a set of green BN SD40s thundered westward toward Marias Pass. The mid-block signal dropped from green to red a couple hundred yards up the grade. The track guided the engines away from my line of sight as I stepped up to onto the track ballast. Not quite the rush it could have been if the tight curve and the grade didn't force a walking pace onto every train.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Once I had the tracks to myself, I followed the grade uphill. Half hour later, I diverged onto an abandoned road leading back toward the highway. It had its own bridge over Railroad Creek, though decayed into just a few rotting wooden planks on stringers made from tree trunks.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Arms out for balance, I marched onto the boards’ remains, keeping my path aligned with a single log. Peering down at the roiling spring whitewater, I half stepped, half hopped over the death gap to switch sides.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I climbed back up to the highway and crossed into the forest on the other side. A well-trodden game trail routed me toward my cabin, but I split off just below the ridge-line. The familiar hillside traverse took me right to my back door. Every trail, every road, every view in this valley was mine.</p>
<p>I had used only ninety minutes of my four-hour wait.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As the sun had not yet risen high enough to warm my cabin, I stoked the wood stove and settled down in the loft to read. I had mail-ordered a book about a programming language called "C.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Someday, I’d have access to a C compiler.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I read and sketched algorithm implementations with a mechanical pencil on my green engineering pad, executing the code in my head.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Another ninety minutes passed in silence.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My biking clothes seemed inadequate: my good jeans without the rips, the jean jacket, my hiking boots, and the lighter pair of my skiing gloves. Pretty much the same gear as hiking.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I lived a make-do life.</p>
<h2 id="TheBlackfeetReservation,Montana">The Blackfeet Reservation, Montana</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I arrived a full twenty minutes early.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Standing in the gravel lot between the tracks and the highway, I leaned on my bike watching the eastbound lane of US2. A group of four Harleys emerged from the Glacier Park Hotel side of the railroad underpass. They stopped at the intersection, turned right, westbound,  to head up Marias Pass, and, I assumed, on to West Glacier. One of the passengers raised a hand to me. I waved back.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The Amtrak Empire Builder rolled in from the West, disgorging a flock of tourists. Only a three minute stop. It lumbered out with a roar, accelerating with great plumes of dark exhaust, heading toward the green highball way down at the other end of town.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>On the opposite side of the tracks, a line of four bright Red Jammers, the Park’s vintage motor coaches, waited in front of the original log Great Northern Railway station. One at a time, each jammer pulled away from the station with an earsplitting grind of their elderly unsynchronized transmissions. Some looped around to the big hotel just a hundred yards across the road while others headed North to the sister hotel at Many Glacier.</p>
<p>I sighed as ten o'clock came and went.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Another eastbound Burlington Northern freight passed by the station without slowing.  Not long afterwards, one rumbled by the other direction.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>At half past the hour, I got up, stretched and kicked the gravel. It skittered into the depression of a dried up puddle. Fuck. Stupid to think this fantasy would come true.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I opened a saddle bag, took a long drag from my water bottle, and ate a handful of my trail mix. Trying to reseal the plastic bag with the water bottle tucked under my arm, I fumbled it.  Half of the trail mix dumped onto the gravel while the bottle rolled into the puddle basin.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Shit, shit, shit. Everything goes to shit.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I would do the ride alone: just as always in everything, by myself. I stowed the water bottle. I remounted the bike, turned the key to on.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The telltale syncopated rhythm of Harley pipes whipped my head around. David crossed over the centerline of US2 and onto the gravel. My heart leapt to my throat. I let out a long breath I hadn't realized I held.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Howdy," David called over the noise of his bike. He parked, dismounted, and proffered his hand. Surprised, I reached out, but instead of clasping hands, he wrapped his hand around my wrist. I jerked back, not understanding. He didn’t let go, just nodded looking down, triggering me to copy his clasp. He gave a single shake, and let go.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"That’s how you check if the other guy’s got a blade." He smirked.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I think I just got a first lesson in biker culture.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0037" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You ready to ride?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I nodded, trying not be too eager.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He pointed to the underpass. "Two Medicine Road, cut over to 49, then 89 up to Many Glacier. Lunch. After that, 464 down to Browning, US2 to Cut Bank, then 358..." He gave me a sideways glance. "You ride gravel?"</p>
<p>"Only my road up to my cabin."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“We’ll see how you feel about Molly's Nipple Road.” He smirked again. “Could head all the way down to Valier, but Molly’s Nipple’s a helluva lot more fun.” He shrugged. “Either way, we’ll drop down to Dupuyer, then cut back up to Heart Butte. You got all that?”</p>
<p>"I'll follow."</p>
<p>David followed on with instructions on how to ride with another motorcycle. Under no circumstances was I to try to ride beside him. He wanted me always at least ten car lengths behind him. I agreed to his rules.</p>
<p>We took off into the joy of the wind.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Highway 49 was just as much fun as it had been the previous week. However, his Harley was not as nimble as my little Honda. I kept creeping up on him in the curves and had to keep very mindful of hanging back. Got kind of frustrating, I wanted to ride faster.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>At the town of Babb, near the Many Glacier cut-off, he pulled in at a roadside tavern. There were about a dozen other bikes, a mixture of Harleys, BMW boxers, and those giant Honda Goldwings. They sat in groups of the same make. No Hondas near the Harleys. The BMVs on their own.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Once inside with our meals, he took offense when I wouldn’t drink a beer. The second time I turned down his offer, he narrowed his eyes and threw the accusation in my face. "What, you too good for a drink? "</p>
<p>He gestured out the window toward the parking lot as if it were obvious. “This is what these machines are for. Harley straight-up calls 'em ‘bar hoppers.’” He sneered. “Oh yeah, forgot—you’re on that Jap junk. Guess you ought to be sippin’ sake over a bowl of ramen instead.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My cheeks flushed. I looked down at the table, at the dregs of our meal.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0050" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>David took a long pull from his bottle before I looked at him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0051" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I can't drink." Confession of failure.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0052" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He barked the question. "You gotta Probation Officer?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Medical problem." I enunciated the words trying to draw my line in the sand without offending him, "I cannot drink."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0054" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>His eyebrows lowered with scowl. He didn't believe me. He drained his bottle and set it down with a hard clunk.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We both stayed stonily silent until the waitress brought our separate tickets. I parted with money that could have bought me two tanks of gas.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0056" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The next two hours of our ride included stopping at bars twice: Browning and Cut Bank. Both times, David was in the door before I had even gotten off the bike. I joined him at the bar, but he didn't talk to me. He talked to the bartenders. They knew him by name. He made no introductions.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0057" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I might as well have been in the places by myself.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Forty five minutes after Cut Bank, heading down MT358, a sign for the gravel road, Molly's Nipple, whipped by. Either David had forgotten about it, or passing it meant he cast a vote of no confidence on my riding.</p>
<p>———> rewrite CUT148</p>
<p>In mid-afternoon, he pulled into a tavern in the town of Duyper. I followed him in. We sat at the bar. He ordered beer. I ordered 7-up. He gave me the side eye.</p>
<p>After some silence, he set is beer down and turned his eyes at me. "Are you a free man?"</p>
<p>"Most people don’t got a fuckin’ clue, but the so-called ‘government’? Total fraud. Not what the Founding Fathers created.”</p>
<p>"Well, yeah, I think things have gotten kind of twisted over the last 200 years. It galls me that Reagan, a fuckin' Hollywood actor, is in the White House." I wondered where he was going with this.</p>
<p>“It’s way deeper than that.” He leaned in, voice low like he was letting me in on some great secret. “Back in the 1800s, they flipped the whole damn system, turned the Federal government into a corporation. A real, actual business. We ain’t citizens of a country anymore, we’re assets. Property."</p>
<p>He jabbed a finger on the bar for emphasis. “All them laws, taxes, licenses? Total bullshit. Just wayso keep us under their boot. How’d they drag my ass to ‘Nam? Slavery, plain and simple. They claim to own us, like we’re just numbers in their system, and we’re supposed to jump when they say to.”</p>
<p>I added, "Carter restarted the Selective Service in 1980. I was in the first group that had to register. I certainly didn't feel like I had freedom,” I said mainly to appease him. I was wondering if he was about to morph the conversation into a pitch for Amway.</p>
<p>David shook his head, dead serious. “That’s just it. You signed, and that put you under their thumb. You entered a contract with the Federal Corporation. But here’s the thing—” he leaned in, “you did it under duress. And you can get out of it.”</p>
<p>"Yeah?" My interest piqued.</p>
<p>David’s eyes burned with conviction as he leaned in. “It’s called ‘withdrawin’ your consent.’ For your first step, you send ‘em a formal affidavit—straight up declare that you signed under duress, didn’t understand the nature of the so-called ‘contract,’ and that you’re takin’ back your sovereign status.”</p>
<p>He smirked, like he took pride in knowing something I didn't. “Now, they ain’t gonna like it. Might push back, maybe even threaten you. But here’s the thing—they ain’t got lawful authority to force you into a contract you didn’t knowingly enter. Whole game’s about trickin’ folks into playin’ along. You just gotta stand firm, know the loopholes, and move through their bullshit system without givin’ ‘em your consent.”</p>
<p>This guy had no fucking clue about civic or legal structure. "So if this is true, how did you end up in Vietnam?"</p>
<p>David exhaled sharply, shaking his head like I was missing the obvious. “Same thing that you did, kid—I was young, signed somethin' I didn't understand while not knowin' my real rights. The ones the Founding Fathers laid down before the government twisted everything. They tricked me, same as everybody else.”</p>
<p>He leaned back, tilting his beer. “But I know better now. I don’t pay income tax—‘cause the Founders never set up no goddamn income tax. I don’t register my truck—‘cause they got zero authority under the Constitution to make me pay a fee just to travel. We’re all Sovereign Citizens—we just gotta wake up and start acting like it.”</p>
<p>"Wait a minute, you’ve got license plates on the back of your bike." I even knew the plate number—I'm always looking for patterns.</p>
<p>David exhaled hard, shaking his head. “Jesus, you are so goddamn like Derick. Got that plate off a wrecked scoot in a junkyard. Keeps the badge boys off my ass.”</p>
<p>He smirked. “Tribal cops don’t give a shit—I’m white, so they leave me alone. Sheriff’s boys and the highway patrol? They barely show their faces out on the rez. Long as I don’t give ‘em a reason, they don’t come sniffin’ around.”</p>
<p>———> end CUT148</p>
<p>Abruptly changing the subject, he just said, "Highway,” and gestured toward the exit. This cut off my question, “Who's Derick?”</p>
<p>We left the tavern, and remounted our bikes, and pointed back North up US89. Until this point in our ride, I had tagged along quite a distance behind him - this time, I shadowed him more closely. This guy got more and more intriguing with every crazy statement.</p>
<p>Just before getting to Heart Butte, he pulled over at a dirt road that wound up a hill to the West. I pulled in behind him and shut off the motor.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0081" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He shouted to me from his bike. "I live up that way. You don’t wanna take that thing up there. You’d dump it in the first fifty yards. From here, you can head north until..."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0082" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I know how to get home from here." I'd ridden by this spot a dozen times in the last month practicing. Never even noticed his road.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0083" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Ride again next week." He spoke as if he granted a gift. "Heard they’re openin’ Going to the Sun this week."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0084" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yes." The grin overpowered my struggle to keep my face neutral.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0085" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Same spot in East Glacier. Longer ride this time. Be there at nine.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0086" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He had started his bike before he could have even heard my "Yes."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0087" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The he vanished up his road through the trees. It took about a half minute for him to kill his engine, presumably at his cabin. I knew how long his driveway was.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0088" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Back on the road, my emotions rolled with the bumps and curves. The tuft of dark chest hair that peeked out from his T-shirt, collar. The hairy arms. The unshaven stubble. Even his constant ribbing me about my bike. That Sovereign Citizen thing seemed nuts.</p>
<p>Too much to think about. Soon, though, the curves of the road pushed the thoughts of my mind aside. I had to concentrate on the road, the bike, and my body, leaning into the twists, turns, dips, and ascents of the road winding through the hummocky glacially carved landscape.</p>
