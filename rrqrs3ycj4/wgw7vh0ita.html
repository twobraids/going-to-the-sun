            <h2 id="RailroadCreekValley,Montana">Railroad Creek Valley, Montana</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I woke just after dawn on the day of my first ride with David the biker. Breakfast didn't sit right, I ate too fast. Nerves.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I trudged out to the shed, checked the bike’s oil level, tire pressure, and gas level. Again. Like last night. Like yesterday afternoon. No spontaneous leaks.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Can't let anything go wrong today.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Yesterday's trips to the Amtrak station all took just over ten minutes. Considered running it again. Nah.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>With four hours to kill before meeting up with David, I chose a hike. The railroad loop path. Maybe some sun. Chilly morning.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I hoofed down the gravel road to where it joined the asphalt of US2: my wreck site. My typical walk up to the tracks crossed the highway further east. I needed to see the spot up close today, remind myself not to fuck up again. The asphalt betrayed nothing about my humiliating wipeout. No scrapes. No debris. Just our secret.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Since that day, gas ate most of my daily budget. Burned up a whole tank every single day: between a hundred seventy and two hundred miles. Couldn't keep that up. Not enough money. Not enough paved roads on the Rez.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I waited for a car to pass, then sauntered across the highway.  The sunken roadbed of the 1930s incarnation of US2 emerged from under the modern pavement halfway up the east hill. It made for a good hiking path through the growing mullein spikes away from the traffic. After a quarter mile, I turned onto the  Burlington Northern maintenance road cut into the side of the bluff and on up to the tracks.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A low rumble from above got me sprinting up the last pitch as a set of green BN SD40s thundered westward toward Marias Pass. The mid-block signal dropped from green to red a couple hundred yards up the grade. The track angled the engines away from my line of sight as I stepped onto the ballast. Not quite the rush it could have been if the tight curve and the grade didn't force every train to a walking pace.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Once I had the tracks to myself, I followed the grade uphill. Half an hour later, I detoured onto an abandoned road meandering back toward the highway. It had its own bridge over Railroad Creek, though it had decayed into a few rotting wooden planks on stringers made from tree trunks.</p>
<p>Arms out for balance, I ventured onto the rotting boards, keeping my path aligned with a single supporting log. Peering down at the roiling  whitewater runoff, I half-stepped, half-hopped over the death gap to switch sides.</p>
<p>I climbed back up to the highway and crossed into the forest on the other side. A well-trodden game trail routed me toward my cabin, but I split off just below the ridge-line. The familiar hillside traverse took me right to my back door. Every trail, every road, every view in this valley was mine.</p>
<p>I used up only ninety minutes of my four-hour wait.</p>
<p>My cabin, crowded by the forest, wouldn't see the sun until late morning. Technically, it was nearly mid summer, but I had to stoke the wood stove for some heat. I settled down in the loft to read a mail-ordered book about the programming language called C.</p>
<p>Someday, I’d have access to a C compiler.</p>
<p>I read and sketched algorithm implementations with a mechanical pencil on my green engineering pad, executing the code in my head.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Two hours passed in silence.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My riding gear looked so lame: my jeans without the rips, the denim jacket, my hiking boots, and the lighter pair of my skiing gloves. Pretty much the same things I wore everyday no matter where I went. I rebraided my hair and beard, then tied a bandana into a head band.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>David would be in that black leather with the Harley logo. I would look like an idiot.</p>
<h2 id="TheBlackfeetReservation,Montana">The Blackfeet Reservation, Montana</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I arrived at the empty lot on the highway side of the East Glacier Park railroad station a full twenty minutes early.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I sat side saddle on the bike, boots on the gravel, my eyes on the eastbound lane of US2. David would come from that direction.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A group of four rumbling Harley Tour Glides emerged from the Glacier Park Hotel side of the railroad underpass. They stopped at the intersection, turned right, westbound, to head up Marias Pass and on to West Glacier. One of the passengers raised a hand to me. I waved back.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The Amtrak Empire Builder rolled in from the West, disgorging a flock of tourists. Only a three-minute stop. It lumbered out with a roar, accelerating with great plumes of dark exhaust, heading toward the green highball way down at the other end of town. Next stop Cut Bank.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>On the far side of the tracks, a line of four bright Red Jammers, the Park’s vintage motor coaches, waited in front of the original log Great Northern Railway station. One at a time, each jammer pulled away with an earsplitting grind of its elderly unsynchronized transmission. Two of them looped around to the big hotel just a hundred yards across the road while the other two headed north to the sister hotel at Many Glacier.</p>
<p>Ten o'clock came and went as I fidgeted against the bike.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Without slowing, two freights, ten minutes apart, rumbled by the station in opposite directions.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Somebody honked a horn on the highway.  Folks on the sidewalk in front of the Glacier Park Trading Post, my closest grocery store, waved back.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>At half past the hour, I stood up, stretched, and kicked the gravel. It skittered into the depression of a dried up puddle.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Fuck. Stupid to think this fantasy would come true.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I opened a saddlebag, took a long pull from my water bottle, and ate a handful of my trail mix. Trying to reseal the plastic bag with the water container tucked under my arm, I fumbled them both. Half of the trail mix dumped onto the gravel while the bottle rolled into the puddle basin.</p>
<p>Shit, shit, shit. Everything goes to shit.</p>
<p>I would do the ride alone: just like always, everything, everywhere, by myself. I stowed the water. I remounted the bike, turned the key to on. Ready to bolt.</p>
<p>The telltale syncopated rhythm of Harley pipes whipped my head around. David crossed over the centerline of US2 and onto the gravel. My heart leapt to my throat. I let out a long breath I hadn't realized I held.</p>
<p>"Howdy," David called over the noise of his bike. He parked, dismounted, and extended his hand. Surprised, I reached out, but a instead of a normal handshake, he wrapped his hand around my wrist. I jerked back, not understanding. He didn’t let go, just nodded, looking down. Took me a second to understand. I grabbed his wrist. He gave a single shake, and let go.</p>
<p>"That’s how you check if the other guy’s got a blade." He smirked.</p>
<p>My first lesson in biker culture.</p>
<p>"You ready to ride?"</p>
<p>I nodded, trying not be too eager.</p>
<p>He pointed to the underpass. "Two Medicine Road, cut over to 49, then 89 up to Many Glacier. Lunch. After that, 464 down to Browning, US2 to Cut Bank, then 358..." He gave me a sideways glance. "You ride gravel?"</p>
<p>"Only my road up to my cabin."</p>
<p>“We’ll see how you feel about Molly's Nipple Road.” He smirked again. “Could head all the way down to Valier, but Molly’s Nipple’s a helluva lot more fun.” He shrugged. “Either way, we’ll drop down to Dupuyer, then cut back up to Heart Butte. You got all that?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I had followed along with his route on my mental map of the road network. I didn't know Molly's Nipple Road, but it wouldn't be my first time on any of those other highways.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I'll follow."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Here's the rules. Do not try to ride next to me, stay back." He looked me up and down. "Ten car lengths back."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Ten? That seemed excessive.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0048" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Watch my signals so you know where to turn."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I nodded. It was just a big loop around the Rez, no way to miss the turns.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0050" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He remounted his Harley, kicked it to life with a roar. We took off into the wind.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0051" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Highway 49 over Looking Glass hill was not as much fun as it had been yesterday. His Harley was not as nimble as my little Honda. I kept creeping up on his ass.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0052" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>In honor of his ten car rule, I pulled off the edge of the asphalt and stopped as he disappeared around the next curve.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I examined the strata of the road cut: mostly just glacial till, like my own cabin's hillside. I marked time for a while, then switched to watching the highway out in the valley below. Took about five minutes for David to emerge onto that long straight section before the junction at US89.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0054" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I could do it in two. Stomped the bike back into first and took the curves at my own speed. The right way to do it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When I dropped onto that stretch before 89, he stood still at the intersection way ahead. Expected him to make the left long before I got near him. As I slowed for the approach, he watched me over his shoulder. Before I got close enough to say anything, he took off. He timed it so I got stuck behind the land whale motorhome, while he got ahead of it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0056" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>At the town of Babb, near the cut-off to Many Glacier, he pulled in at a roadside tavern. There were about a dozen other bikes, Harleys, BMW boxers, and those giant Goldwings. They sat in groups of the same make. No Hondas near the Harleys. The BMWs off on their own. David parked at an angle that meant I had to follow the rule. Not next to him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0057" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>As I walked in, only a minute behind him, he gestured me to the seat next to him at the bar. Didn't expect it, figured he'd want me ten stool lengths away. But I took it his offer.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After eating, the bartender, a smiling older woman from the tribe, offered to refill my seven-up.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0059" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"No, give him a beer." He knocked the backs of his fingers on the countertop in front of me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0060" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shook my head. "No, I don't want one." I smiled at the woman. "Just some water will do."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0061" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He narrowed his eyes, "What, you too good for a drink?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0062" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I drew back in my seat.</p>
<p>He gestured out the window toward the parking lot as if it were obvious. “This is what these machines are for. Harley straight-up calls 'em ‘bar hoppers.’” He sneered. “Oh yeah, forgot, you’re on that Jap junk. Guess you ought to be sippin’ sake over a bowl of ramen instead.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0064" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My cheeks flushed. I looked down at the bar, at the dregs of our meal.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0065" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>David took a long slow pull from his bottle.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0066" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>With a quick turn of my head toward him, I said, "I can't drink." My confession of failure.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0067" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He laughed. "You gotta Parole Officer, don’t you?" He grinned like he found the prize. “Is it that asshole, Knudsen?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0068" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Medical problem." I enunciated the words. "I cannot drink."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0069" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He grinned and shook his head. “You’re a liar.”  He drained his bottle and set it down with a hard clunk.</p>
<p>We both stayed stonily silent until the waitress brought our separate tickets. I parted with money that could have bought me two tanks of gas.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0071" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>For the next two hours, the roads followed the high line over the Blackfeet land. High rolling plains in a harsh environment. Views into Canada. Straight roads, not flat roads.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0072" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We stopped twice for beer: Browning and Cut Bank. Both times, David was in the door before I even had the side stand down. I joined him at the bar, but he didn't talk to me. He talked to the bartenders. They knew him by name, but he offered no introductions.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0073" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Forty-five minutes down MT358 after Cut Bank, the sign for Molly's Nipple road whipped by. Either David had forgotten about it, or he cast a vote of no confidence on my riding.</p>
<p>Goddamn, I followed him like a kicked puppy.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0075" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I hung back a couple miles behind him, practicing rolling the throttle and hard braking. The motorcycle analog to kicking the dirt.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0076" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He had rolled straight to the tavern in Dupuyer. Nearly missed the turn as he had concealed his bike in the building's shadow.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0077" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He already had his beer when I hit the stool next to him at the counter. The bartender, a woman in her forties, tanned like she did ranch work, put a can of Rainier in front of me. She swept up the cash he'd set on the scarred bar, swapping it for his change.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0078" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I slid the can over to David.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0079" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Excuse me. I want to order." I had to raise my voice to get her attention.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0080" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The woman turned around, refocusing on me. "What can I get you, hon'?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0081" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"7-up."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0082" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"All we got's Sprite."  She turned away to scoop ice.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0083" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We sat in silence until she'd landed a glass with a bright pink straw in front of me. She didn't stick around to talk to David.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0084" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Man, they got you penned." He set his beer down and turned to me. "You're not a free man, are ya'?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0085" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stared at the straw, pulled it out and dropped it on the counter. David only got side-eye from me, not an answer.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0086" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"How often they testing you?" He shook his head. "You don't have to stand for it. They got no right to tell you what to do."</p>
<p>"It's medical."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0088" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah, sure." He pulled out a pack, tapped out a cigarette, but just held it between two fingers. "I get it. You don’t got a fuckin’ clue about this so-called government. It's a fraud. You can drink, smoke, or snort anything you want. They can't touch you."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0089" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I let that go, watching the condensation pool around my glass. He could tell whatever story he wanted.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0090" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He patted a couple pockets without finding his lighter. After a moment, I slid an empty ashtray with matchbooks over to him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0091" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He nodded. "It's okay. So they got you under their thumb. I know how you can get out of it."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0092" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I turned to look at him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0093" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He struck a match, lit the cigarette, and took his first drag. He exhaled the smoke high out into the air over the cash register behind the bar.</p>
<p>He leaned in, voice low like he was letting me in on some great secret. “Hundred years ago, they flipped the whole damn system, turned the government into a corporation. A real, actual business. They turned citizens into assets. Property."</p>
<p>He jabbed a finger on the bar. “All them laws, taxes, licenses? Total bullshit. Just so keep us under their boot. They dragged my ass to ‘Nam. Slavery, plain and simple. They try to own us, like we’re just numbers in their system, cattle in the feedlot.”  He paused, looking at me hard. "They get you on the draft roll?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0096" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>David had transformed in front of me. Passion replaced his distain. This was energy I had to engage. "Carter restarted the Selective Service in 80. I was in the first group that had to register." I laughed. "I gotta admit. it didn't feel like freedom."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0097" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>David nodded his head, dead serious. “That’s just it. You signed, and that put you under their thumb. You entered a contract with the Federal Corporation. But here’s the thing," he leaned in again, "you did it under what's called 'duress'. And you can get out of it."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0098" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He loved talking about this. A feverish light flared behind his eyes, cutting through the beer haze. His slouch over the bar straightened to chest-out pride. He became beautiful like he'd been at Teeples when me met.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0099" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>David's voice tightened with conviction as he leaned in. "It’s called withdrawin' your consent. First step, you mail 'em a formal affidavit. Straight up declare that you signed under duress, didn’t understand the nature of the so-called contract, and that you’re takin' back your sovereign status."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0100" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A tuft of dark chest hair poking over his collar, twitched slightly with his breath matching the cadence of his lecture. Under that dark stubble, the corners of his mouth had dimples. I hadn't been brave enough, or, hell, even had the opportunity, to look so closely at his face.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0101" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He smirked, pride in knowing something I didn't. “Now, they ain’t gonna like it. Might push back, maybe even threaten you. But here’s the thing, they ain’t got lawful authority to force you into a contract you didn’t knowingly enter. Whole game’s about trickin’ folks into playin’ along. You just gotta stand firm, know the loopholes, and ride through their bullshit system without givin’ ‘em your consent."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0102" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>His eyebrows didn't quite meet in the middle, but they marked time to his voice, one moment high, the next, down and furrowed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0103" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He had no fucking clue about civic or legal structure, but I had to keep him engaged, so I could keep looking at him. "So, how did you end up in Vietnam?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0104" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>David exhaled sharply, shaking his head like I was missing the obvious. “Same thing that you did, kid. I was young, signed somethin' I didn't understand. Didn't know my real rights, the ones the Founding Fathers laid down before the government twisted everything. They tricked me, same as everybody else."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0105" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He picked up the second beer, the one he bought for me. He flipped the tab and tilted it into his mouth. "But I know better now. I don’t pay income tax. Founders never set up no goddamn income tax. I don’t register my truck. State's got no authority under the Constitution to make me pay a fee to travel. We’re all Sovereign Citizens. We just gotta wake up and start acting like it.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0106" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The cords in his neck echoed the rhythm, too: punctuation for his gesturing arms. He spoke with his whole body.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0107" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Took me a second to realize he stopped because he waited for me to say something. The silence stretched as I frantically ran the program backwards to remember his words—got it. "What about the plate on your bike?" The plate number, 2-6335, appeared in my head.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0108" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>David exhaled hard, shaking his head. "Jesus, you are so like goddamn Derick."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0109" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He stopped talking, drew back a second, like he'd forgotten the script. Took him a moment to recover.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0110" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Got that plate off a wrecked scoot in a junkyard. Keeps the badge boys off my ass." He smirked. "Tribal cops don’t give a shit. I’m white, they leave me alone."</p>
<p>"Who's Derick?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0112" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He frowned hard at me, as if the name was an insult. The original David took over the body and smelled something foul. He stood up.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0113" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Highway." His stool scraped the floor, wobbling for a second as he headed to the door.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0114" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>David took off north up US89.  I followed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0115" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>This time I paced him for an hour, just a few seconds behind. I chewed on his antigovernment rant and fire. Heard of guys like him holed up in the mountains. It turned me on.</p>
<p>Just before Heart Butte, he pulled over at a dirt road that wound up a hill to the West. I pulled in behind him and shut off the motor.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0117" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He shouted to me from his bike over the ticking of his cooling engine. "I live up that way. It's rough, you don’t wanna take that rice burner up there. You’d dump it in the first ten yards." He pointed north up the highway. "From here, you can head north until..."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0118" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I know how to get home from here." I'd ridden by this spot a dozen times in the last month, practicing. Never even noticed his road.</p>
<p>"They’re openin’ Going to the Sun this weekend. We'll ride again next week."</p>
<p>"Yes." The grin overpowered my struggle to keep my face neutral.</p>
<p>“Same spot in East Glacier. Longer ride this time. Be there at nine.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0122" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He had kicked the engine over before my second "Yes" left my mouth.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0123" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He vanished up his road through the trees, his bike loud enough I could track him without seeing him. He cut the engine about a minute later. His cabin must have been only a hundred yards up the draw in the hillside.</p>
<p>Back on the road, my emotions rolled with the bumps and curves. Too much to think about. Seemed more willing to accept me if he thought I was in trouble with the law.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0125" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Goddamn he was beautiful. The tuft of dark chest hair, the hairy arms, the stubble.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0126" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Even his constant criticism of my bike?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0127" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I knew I'd have to deal with this hard-on when I got back to my cabin.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0128" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The road eventually pushed the thoughts aside. Had to focus on the pavement, the bike, and leaning into the curves and dips of this post-glacial landscape.</p>
