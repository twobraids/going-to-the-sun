            <h2 id="RailroadCreekRanch">Railroad Creek Ranch</h2>
<p>I peeked out my front door at the snow. Yesterday, the high had only been nineteen degrees. The storm came through during the night from the West. It clearly didn't exhaust its moisture crossing the mountains as the landscape went from bare earth to two feet of snow overnight. Hard to see the real accumulation, the wind rearranges it into drifts. The biggest one plugged my road down to the ranch—don't think even the Subaru could get through it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I donned my goose down parka and boots to fetch fire wood. I spent so much of October chopping wood—ten cords for Gladys and five for me. My wood shed only held three, so I had two cords out in the snow. I needed to tarp it, but never got around to it. No need to worry. This snow wouldn’t last.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The Ironhead Sportster was gone. Vince said he didn't want it sitting in a wood shed unprotected for the Winter. A couple weeks ago, Dolph dropped by and took it away. Yeah, I needed the space in the woodshed, but I confess to shedding a tear after Dolph left with it strapped down in the back of his pickup. Not my bike—but I suppose it was the first bike I ever loved.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Over the next half hour, I hauled in five days of wood into the A-frame. My wood bin only held a half day's worth, so this, so I had to stack the wood on the floor on either side of the wood stove.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Wood—cheaper than the propane.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It’s rare for the snow to last very long around here. Either the wind blows it away as it falls or it sublimates in the cold.</p>
<p>If the winds died down by afternoon, I planned on skiing up to the railroad tracks and then take the South loop back around to the cabin.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0008" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Once I got the fire roaring, I made my oatmeal breakfast and sat shivering at the little table by the front window. The ceiling fan doesn't work, so I can't distribute the heat evenly across the whole interior of the cabin. The loft was where I lived in the winter—up where the heat collected.</p>
<p>Since there's only just a ladder into the loft, it's hard to bring a bowl of oatmeal up. So I ate in the cold.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After eating, I lifted weights. Vince had insisted that become stronger to defend myself. He supplied the dumbells last fall and Dolph coached me on how to use them. After all that wood chopping, and, I guess because I’m young, I could see my progress rack up quickly.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0011" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I had taken only a couple of the Aikido classes that Sarah roped me into. After David, she wanted all her girls trained to defend themselves. They were just too far away for me to go regularly.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0012" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I climbed into the loft to spend my morning studying. I had subscribed to two magazines: Byte and Dr. Dobb's Journal of Software Tools. From the ads in the back, I found I could mail order technical books, that how I acquired K&R's The C Programming Language; The Art of Computer Programming; Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid; and The Fractal Geometry of Nature. With the new influx of cash from the Iron Horse, I added a shelf of new technical programming books for the long winter: Smalltalk-80; Common Lisp: The Language; APL: A Programming Language; FORTRAN 77 Programming; SQL/Data System; and finally, The Theory of Poker.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>That last book was my backup. The reality is that I'm dealing cards for the second time in my life—might be the only career I ever get to have. Practicality—nobody hires programmers from biker bars. Somebody to ought hire me to ride my motorcycle.  I snorted out loud at the thought.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I grabbed the Smalltalk book and propped myself up in the bed in the loft under the USGS topo map of Glacier Park.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I heard a motor behind the wind noise. I looked up and focused on listening—a truck, not low enough rumble for a train, not a snowmobile. It only got louder.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I jumped out of bed and climbed down the ladder to the front room—it was coming up my road. I pulled on my parka and boots and opened the door just as a snow plow, headlights mounted up over the blade, pushed into the open area in front of the cabin.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It turned and shoved its bow wave of tumbling slow deftly down the embankment left of my wood shed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph's F250.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0020" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Over the next five minutes, Dolph cleared all the snow drifts off my parking era opening path for my Subaru to easily drive out.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Once he completed the job, he parked and jumped out of the truck. He didn't give any greeting—typical silent Dolph—he just stepped up to me and held out an envelope.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"We got to get going, weather's bad."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Going, where are we going?" I looked at him with confusion.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0024" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Open the letter. Vince wants you in Cut Bank."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Cut Bank? What’s in Cut Bank? I'm surprised they haven’t closed the highway."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0026" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"They might, gotta go now."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0027" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"C'mon in. Let me read this letter." I turned around and walked back inside without looking to see if Dolph would follow me. He didn't and it felt really weird to just shut the door on him. I stood in the doorway. "You can come in, too."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0028" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"We need to get going. Meet me in the truck." He then turned and walked back to the idling diesel.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0029" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I shut the door and walked to the kitchen. I hadn't been running the generator, so I had only the dim twelve volt battery lights over the propane stove to read by. I opened the envelope and pulled out a folded page enclosing a dozen hundred dollar bills. The page had a brief message in Vince's crude handwriting: "Karl: Cut Bank Auction 2pm - Lot 1984-0688.  Bid up to $1200. You sign for it."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0030" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I read it three times trying to understand.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0031" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I thought about my book upstairs in the loft—my day derailed. I resented this intrusion into my solitude. Why do I have to be the one to do this?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0032" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>You're mine now.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0033" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I came down to that again. If I'm going to be a club member, I need to do club business when commanded to do so. Heavy sigh.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0034" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stepped back into my bedroom and changed my clothes—need something more presentable. I turned the propane furnace on, setting the thermostat to about fifty. I dampened down the wood stove. I climbed back into the loft, grabbed my day back and put the book into it—climbed back down. In the kitchen, I collected a bag of trail mix, some jerky and the last apple from last week's grocery run. Parka, tuque, gloves—ready.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0035" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stepped back outside ensuring my door actually latched. I pulled off the parka—wouldn't need it inside the truck. I climbed into the passenger side, stuffing my parka behind the seat.  Not looking forward to long drive with a silent man.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0036" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph nodded to me, putting the truck into gear. We descended the road down to the highway where the wind already had started to fill in his plowing work.</p>
<h2 id="US-2Eastbound">US-2 Eastbound</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0038" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The highway had some patches of hardpack snow, but mostly clear. That lasted about half way to Browning where it shifted to mostly bare pavement with periodic ten yard strips of growing drifts on the leeway sides of hills and road cuts.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After Browning it got much worse. It went back to hardpack, while drifts became deeper and deeper. Dolph knew what to do. He kept the truck in two wheel drive on the dry pavement, and used four wheel drive only on drifts. He mostly just shoved through them, but used the blade to cut into several of them.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I struggled to recall tho last time I saw an oncoming car—bet they closed the highway.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0041" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After carving a path from a particularly deep drift, we encountered a car stopped in the lane just before the next drift—they clearly knew they couldn't get through it. A new drift of their own pilled up on the lee side of their car. Dolph gave out a heavy sigh.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0042" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He stopped behind them, jumped out and approached the car. The driver door opened and he and Dolph talked for a moment, then Dolph gestured to the shoulder side of the drift. The driver nodded and Dolph returned to the truck.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0043" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Gonna plow him a path."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0044" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph put the truck back in gear, moved around to the shoulder side of the drift and began carving it away. He didn't take it down to bare asphalt, but low enough the car could follow.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0045" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Two drifts later, we encountered another car half embedded in drift that had tried to push through.  Dolph used the winch on the front of the truck to pull them backwards from the drift.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It took us an hour to get to Cut Bank. We had picked up a four car convoy behind us. In the long downslope to Cut Bank Creek, we could see a lineup of big rigs behind the Highway Department's road closed gate.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Shit—we're not gonna get back tonight—I don't even have tooth brush with me.</p>
<h2 id="GlacierCountyCourthouse">Glacier County Courthouse</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0049" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We pulled into the lot of the county courthouse, I felt my stomach sink—not a commercial auction—a sheriff auction. I dawned on me why Vince sent me here—it must be David’s Harley. As Dolph pulled into to a parking space next another truck with a blade, I dropped my head into my hands and whispered, “Goddamn you, Vince.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0050" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>What the fuck was I going to do if David's there? Bid against him?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0051" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph heard me and gave me side eye.</p>
<p>“I don’t want David’s bike.” Jesus the first time saw that bike, I lusted after both of them—different now. I gotta lose this auction any way I can. Rode another guy’s bike all summer, Vince wants that permanent.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Knew you’d feel that.” Dolph looked at me with empathetic eyes. “Vince knows. Club justice. The fucker owes you.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0054" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"What am I gonna do if he's here?" I shuttered. "I can't face him."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You can. You will." He leaned toward me. "I got your back."</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0057" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We climbed up the stairs to second floor. Each side of the corridor had its own team of wooden chairs facing each other. A couple of men sat next to a door halfway down the hall. One wore a dirty greasy looking cowboy hat, the other, a red tuque. Neither of them were David.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph was right in allotting so much time before the auction. He managed to get us there just ten minutes before it was to begin.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0059" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We sat in the chairs just across from the closed door marked “Conference”. The other guys parked in chairs just to one side.  The door on our side read "Courtroom." Together, we four waited the conference room to open.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0060" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph pulled out his spiral notebook and his pencil and started adding detail to a drawing of a woman I did not recognize. My jaw dropped on seeing the amazing detail of his artwork. Goddamn, he mastered pencil drawing—looked like a black and white photo except for the light blue horizontal rules slicing the woman’s face.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0061" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I watch him draw for several minutes when I heard the conference room door opened for several men to file out. The first three, Blackfeet Tribal Police. The next guy coming out astonished me—mountain man beard, shaggy three or four inches long from way up on his cheeks just under his eyes. He talked animatedly with the guy behind him. They turned down the corridor revealing “DEA” on the back of the second guy’s coat.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0062" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Four more guys filed out, two more feds and two Glacier County Deputies.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0063" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After a couple minutes, the County Sheriff stepped out and looked around the hallway looking somewhat startled. "Oh. Didn't expect anybody would show today. Guess we're having an auction after all."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0064" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He looked at the four of us. "You guys can go on in. I'll be back in a few minutes."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0065" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The other guys stood up and walked in as the sheriff headed for the stairs. Dolph and I followed in. I kept scanning the corridor for David, but he wasn't there.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0066" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The room was laid out with a table at one end and a bunch of chairs in rows in the other half of the room. The other guys moved to the far end of the front row and Dolph sat at the near end. I really wanted go sit in the back row. Dolph stopped me with a head gesture to sit next to him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0067" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He flipped a new page over on his notepad and started to rapidly sketch.  Within a few minutes, that bearded DEA agent began to peer at me from the lined paper. Again, I gaped at Dolph's skill.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0068" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"How do you do that? You saw him for two seconds?" It seemed appropriate to whisper.</p>
<p>The other guys talked about getting feed to cattle in some south field.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0070" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph shrugged. Then turned to look at me. "Thought you'd like it." His deft pencil added details to the eyes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0071" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Enchanted, I watch him draw until the sheriff returned with a pile of papers and sat down at the table at the head of the room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0072" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Figured the weather might keep folks home. Still, you’re here, and that means by law we proceed with the auction. Since it’s just the four of you, let’s make this simple—tell me which lots you intend to bid on, and we’ll save ourselves a long reading.“</p>
<p><b><span id="U0073" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He shifted his gaze to the other two guys. “Dale, you and John want are after that truck, yeah?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0074" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The older guy with the cowboy hat spoke up. “The F250, not that Datsun tin can.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0075" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The sheriff gave Dale an impatient sigh. “I’m not stupid, Dale.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0076" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He turned to Dolph and me, but addressed Dolph. “I don’t know you gentlemen, what are you bidding on? The Harley or maybe you want the tin can?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0077" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph turned to me, but I stayed silent. He did even wait a second before nudging me hard on the shoulder.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0078" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Again Vince voice whispered in my ear from last summer, “You’re mine now.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0079" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I gave a heavy sigh and spoke. “The Harley.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0080" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The sheriff looked down at his papers and shook his head. “The state's not gonna get what they want today. Gentlemen, by braving the weather, you getting good deals.” He started flipping through his sheets of paper until he found one of the right ones.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0081" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Found the motorcycle, so it’s first up." He read through all the state required preamble and item description out loud. "The bidding starts at five hundred." He looked up at me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0082" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stayed quiet until Dolph tapped me again. “Five hundred,” I heard myself say, and even to me it sounded low and morose.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0083" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The sheriff lowered an eyebrow and eyed me with that skeptical cop  expression.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0084" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Any other bids?" He paused for only two seconds. "Going once, going twice, sold to the guy that for some reason doesn't seem happy about the deal he just got."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0085" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He held out a piece of paper. "Take this down to the recorder's office on the ground floor.  Fill it out the paper work. She'll give you the title transfer form to sign and directions on where to pickup the bike."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0086" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I didn't move. Dolph stood up, took the paper, frowning at me.  We walked out as the sheriff started to read the preamble for the sale of David's F250.</p>
<p>We went out to the corridor toward the stairs down to the recorders office. We walked in silence through the doorway.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0088" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>———> Holy shit, nobody wants to read about going to the county recorder's office.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0089" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I handed the lady the sheriff's paper. She read it, nodded and turned away to a filing cabinet. Pulled out some forms brought them back to me and handing me a pen.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0090" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When I finally handed them back to her, she gave me DMV's registration form, stamped with the county seal. "You need to keep this form with the vehicle until the state DMV returns your registration and title." She smiled at me. "You know where the county road shop is?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0091" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph answered for me. "Yup."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0092" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"They keep bikes inside the maintenance shop. Just hand them this form and you can load the bike up.  You've got ten business days before we start charging a storage fee."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0093" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She looked over the form I had submitted, then looked at me. “You guys going back to East Glacier?” She shook her head. “Honey, hope you’re not trying t’drive there today. Radio says westbound highway’s closed until tomorrow. Motels gonna fill up fast.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0094" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I nodded and we walked away, donning our winter coats.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0095" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We drove off through the snowy streets to find the county shops.</p>
<p>We had to wait, nobody in the office. The outdoor yard showed no activity, several snowplows sitting unused.</p>
<p>A clerk finally walked in wearing a parka. I handed the paperwork to her. She read it, stamped it and slid it into an empty tray. "We'll open the east side garage door and you can back your vehicle in." She frowned at me, like she thought I was nuts. "Hell of day to do this."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0098" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We returned to the truck and drove around to the east side of the building as the door opened.  Dolph backed in as a guy wearing insulated coveralls and gloves directed him.</p>
<p>As soon as I spotted David’s bike, I reacted just as I knew I would. Anxiety rose in my chest and throat—didn't want to even look at it. I felt so bad taking his bike fully aware of the irony—it's not his fault that he's so fucked up. How in the hell am I gonna ride that thing?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0100" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Goddamn, still feeling for the guy that beat me senseless. When does that shit end?</p>
<h2 id="CutBankCreekMotorLodge">Cut Bank Creek Motor Lodge</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0102" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>With David's Wide Glide secured in the bed of Dolph's truck, we pulled up to the motel on the west end of town on US2, two cars ahead of us waiting to get under the awning and somewhat sheltered from the wind.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0103" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Instead of getting in line, he made his own parking space with his blade. "Wait here." Dolph jumped out, getting into the office before anyone in the waiting cars even sent somebody in.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0104" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Ten minutes later, he stepped out, gesturing me come on in. He handed me a key with the number 131 on its large plastic tag. The hallway smelled of cleaners and perfumes unsuccessfully masking cigarette smoke. I walked into the room behind Dolph.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0105" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Seeing it and saying it happened just a split second apart, "There's only one bed."</p>
<p>"Got the last room they had." He looked over his shoulder at me as he stepped up to the furnace and turned it up. After turning the television on, he stood in front of it, twisting the channel dial with a series of mechanical clunks. After a full cycle around, he noticed me still in the doorway. He gave a little huff of a laugh. "Not fixin' to be your john. Get over it."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0107" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I came in, stepped around him, dropped my pack on the desk and dropped onto the room’s only chair. I pulled out my text book to read.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0108" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph continually flipped through channels of midafternoon television, never landing anywhere for more than a few seconds. I hadn't watched television for years, didn’t care to see it.  After five minutes, he settled on some sort of talk show hosted by a guy in his forties with white hair and big squarish metal rimmed glasses. Twitchy guy, walked around talking to the audience as much as his guests sitting in chairs. No celebrities.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0109" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He spoke to a guy with a Christian dog-collar, a white rectangle in the middle of stiff black rim around his neck. "It's true, we can cure gays."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0110" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I let out an “ugh” and rolled my eyes.</p>
<p>The screen blanked and a parade of ads with happy people celebrating solved laundry problems, furniture stores and car lots in Great Falls, and vague feminine products.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0112" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Returning to the program, the host named Phil, introduced a new guest, a clean cut guy, trimmed, shaved and composed. Everything about him, from his stiffly ironed shirt to his polished shoes said evangelical Christian.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0113" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I tried not to pay attention, tried to read my book. Every time I heard the word "gay," my attention derailed. Minutes passed with my irritation growing and growing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0114" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The host: "So, Timothy, you're happily straight after a year in Reverend Coleman's program. You're healed?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0115" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The guest: "Completely. The Lord delivered from that wicked life. I'm engaged to a wonderful Christian woman." He stopped, looked into the camera and grinned a gave a little wave. "Hi honey."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0116" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>A burst of ahs of approval came from the audience accompanied by scattered applause, as the cameras focused on audience members.</p>
<p>They talked on about his experience and wonderfully restored life. I tried to understand the Smalltalk’s Model, View, Controller architecture.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0118" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The show stopped again as the guy, Phil, segued into more advertisements infested with ear worms.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0119" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When the program came back, the host introduced a new guest. "Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to Derek." As if they knew something was amiss, the audience started to mumble, but a few clapped. The camera zoomed into Timothy's shocked and horrified face.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0120" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>His name transfixed me—goddamn it, I couldn't look away.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0121" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The host: "Derek, how do you know Timothy?"</p>
<p>Derek: "We spent the night together at the Apache Motel on Lincoln Avenue, just north of the city. He bought the drinks."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0123" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"That's a lie!" Timothy leapt from his seat as if to strike Derek. “It was Bible study.” His voice cracked.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0124" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I focused back on my book trying to keep the melodrama out of my head—couldn’t tell if it was scripted, ad libbed, somehow real.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0125" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The host: Well, that why we're live, folks. You say you're cured, he says something else." He milked a dramatic pause, "America," pause again, "You decide."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0126" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I had enough. "I'm going out for walk."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0127" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph turned away from the television just long enough to let me know I was crazy.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0128" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I put my jacket, boots, gloves, and tuque back on and walked out of the room, into the lobby and out the door.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0129" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The wind pushed me, but I slogged out to the highway anyway. Once there, however, I saw no way simple way to go anywhere without walking in the tracks of cars on the road.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0130" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stood out by the highway getting angrier and angrier. Goddamn Vince for having put me here. I slogged down the road where a sidewalk would be, expecting even if there were no snow, there wouldn’t be a sidewalk.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0131" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I struggled three quarters of a mile to a railroad crossing.  Looking westward down the tracks, a shining yellow eye over a red one gazed at me down the tracks through the blowing snow. Yellow meant restricted speed—slow enough let me climb on? I imagined riding a boxcar back to my cabin, jumping off on that slow curve down the highway from my cabin.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0132" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I’d probably fucking freeze to death. Suppose that really happens, a boxcar arriving in a Seattle rail yard with a thawing corpse.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0133" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I could survive it, it’d be only a couple hours. If kept moving, generating my own heat, I’d just have to watch the landmarks. Not as if I wouldn’t recognize when to jump. Home's only a twenty minute walk from my slow curve.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0134" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I waited for twenty minutes for the locomotive headlight to appear in the east. At what I judged a quarter mile away, I started counting the seconds. Instant recognition—too fast. No way to hitch a ride on that thing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0135" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I tried to run from the trackside just a moment too late to avoid the diesel powered blizzard. I stopped and crouched down to shield my face. Moments later, as it cleared, I started my trudge back to the motel.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0136" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>While I took the same path, the wind and snow had erased my tracks. I had to break the trail a second time, post holing over the drifts. I had to walk way downslope from the highway grade with to all the idling snowbound trucks lining the highway.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0137" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>By the time I stepped up to the lobby door, the clouds darkened with the setting of the unseen sun. I under the awning feeling beat, the right, westward, side of my body plastered uniformly white. Brushing it off proved a lost cause. I stepped into the lobby, stamped my boots, and loped down the hall to our room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0138" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph still sat on the bed, eyes locked to the television, now entranced by a cartoon. I recognized Rocky the flying squirrel impatiently staring through the fourth wall while Bullwinkle pulled a rhinoceros out of a hat—"Don't know my own stren'th"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0139" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He never even looked up as I stripped my formerly snowy, now wet, clothes and ducked into the bathroom to warm up in the shower. It had been nearly a week—back at my Iron Horse room—multiple incentives for a shower.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0140" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I lingered in the warmth. When I finally got out, my shirt and jacket laid where I dropped them in front of the bathroom door, but my pants and socks were not.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0141" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Drying my hair with the towel, I stepped deeper into the room try to see where I dropped my pants.  Dolph, his eyes not leaving the television, said, “Wet things in a drier. Laundry’s down the hall. I’ll get ‘em when this is over.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0142" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I pulled my undershirt on, then the wool overshirt. Wearing the towel at my waist, I walked through Dolph’s television sightline back to the chair in front of the desk. I reopened my book to read, but instead surreptitiously watched the final segment of Bullwinkle, stunned by all the jokes that had probably gone way over my head as a kid.  I flashed on the memory of my father watching it with me. He had never done that for any other cartoon—revelation.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0143" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When it ended, Dolph fetched my pants. I thanked him, he shrugged.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0144" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Heading to the lounge across the lot.” He pointed with his arm vaguely toward the lobby.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0145" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I nodded and followed him out.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0146" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The lobby, crowded with weary travelers, served as a makeshift shelter. All the seats taken leaving several just standing.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0147" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The lone young woman at the front desk, her face the very definition of exasperation, argued with the angry man in front of her. "I'm sorry sir, we don't have any rooms." Raising her voice, "There are no rooms."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0148" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"What the hell am I supposed to do? I got two kids in the car." His shout made the girl flinch. The phone beside her rang and rang, but she didn't pick it up.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0149" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We walked by quickly—felt sorry for her.  We pushed out through the front door into the snow, across the lot to the roadside restaurant, 4Bs, and the lounge, the Amber Room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0150" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The cigarette smoke hung like fog in the bar. With all the booths occupied, the only seats at the bar were the two closest to the door where the wind whipped in every time it opened. We sat, but left our coats on.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0151" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>At the end of the bar, the space expanded out wider to accommodate a pair of pool tables. I assumed, we could get into the restaurant that way. Unclear if the bar and the restaurant were one business or two. I knew the restaurant name, 4Bs, a regional Montana chain. Never knew one to have a bar attached, though.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0152" style="color: #a46100;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph ordered a shot of bourbon and a beer, I sat for moment, thinking of the special shots that Whiskey made for me—could'a used one right now. I settled for just a ginger ale.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0153" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We sat for a long time in silence, when Dolph turned and looked at me hard. "Why didn't you do it?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0154" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I didn't understand. "Do what?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0155" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"That cure thing."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0156" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>My eyes widened, my face flushed. "I'm not sick. Don't need a fucking cure for who I am." Maybe a bit more annoyance in my voice than I intended.</p>
<p>He nodded and turned back to his beer. "Good." He dropped another moment of silence. "Bastards'r the right place for you."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0158" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I fidgeted in my seat for a minute, then stood up. "I'm gonna checkout that pinball machine in the back."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0159" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph didn't react as I walked away.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0160" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The machine was the same Williams Black Knight that the Iron Horse had. This one needed its launcher lubricated.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0161" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>On the third game, a guy stepped up and started watching me play. I glanced up, "Western Star" on his cap, looked like a trucker. I kept the game going, but I lost ground, then one bad bounce and my last ball dropped between the flippers—game over.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0162" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stepped back and yielded the machine to him. Didn't want to go back and sit with Dolph while he smoked. I watched this guy play. He was better at it than I was. Thought he'd lose that second ball when fired straight to the right out-lane. The ball just stopped in mid trajectory and angled back onto the playfield.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0163" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When he drained the last ball, I said, "I've never seen that magnet thing work. You're good at this machine."</p>
<p>"Just about ever bar on the highline's got this machine. Had ta wait for US2 to reopen dozens of times. Doesn't matter where I stop, same game."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0165" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"There's one at the bar in Columbia Falls." I laughed.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0166" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You with that plow out there with the Harley on the back?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0167" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah" I responded.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0168" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Interesting parking job."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0169" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"I wasn't the driver. I'm just the ride-along."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0170" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Huh, Columbia Falls. You ever been to that biker bar there?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0171" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Yeah, I work there. Card dealer."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0172" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“I’m never been through there at the right time to check it out. Heard a lot about it.”</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0174" style="color: #663300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The truck had Watkins & Shepard on the door. For the first time in my life, I climbed into a big rig—a tight living space in such a huge vehicle. The place smelled male, a bit diesel, cigarette smoke, sweat and unlaundered bedsheets—powerful turn on.</p>
<p>Bill climbed over a tool box and a pile of laundry, then crawled onto the lower bunk. He flipped over onto his back, started rubbing his crotch with a sly smile. I needed no more of an invitation, I followed him into his den.</p>
