            <h2 id="RailroadCreekRanch">Railroad Creek Ranch</h2>
<p>I peeked out my front door at the snow. Yesterday, the high had only been nineteen degrees. The front came through during the night from the West. It clearly didn't exhaust its moisture crossing the mountains as the landscape went from bare earth to two feet of snow since I went to bed. Hard to see the real accumulation, the wind rearranges it into drifts. The biggest one plugged my road down to the ranch—don't think even the Subaru could get through it.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I donned my goose down parka and boots to fetch fire wood. I spent so much of October chopping wood—ten cords for Gladys and five for me. My wood shed only held three, so I had two cords out in the snow. I needed to tarp it, but never got around to it. No need to worry. This snow woulduldn’t last.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The Ironhead Sportster was gone. Vince said he didn't want it sitting in a wood shed unprotected for the Winter. A couple weeks ago, Dolph dropped by and took it away. Yeah, I needed the space in the woodshed, but I confess to shedding a tear after Dolph left with it strapped down in the back of his pickup. Not my bike—but I suppose it was the first bike I ever loved.</p>
<p>Over the next half hour, I hauled in five days of wood into the A-frame. My wood bin only held a half day's worth, so this, so I had to stack the wood on the floor on either side of the wood stove.</p>
<p>Wood—cheaper than the propane.</p>
<p>It’s rare for the snow to last very long around here. Either the wind blows it away as it falls or it sublimates in the cold.</p>
<p>If the winds died down by afternoon, I planned on skiing up to the railroad tracks and then take the West loop back around to the cabin.</p>
<p>Once I got the fire roaring, I made my oatmeal breakfast and sat shivering at the little table by the front window. The ceiling fan doesn't work, so I can't distribute the heat evenly across the whole interior of the cabin. The loft was where I lived in the winter—up where the heat collected.</p>
<p>Since there's only just a ladder into the loft, its hard to bring a bowl of oatmeal up. So I ate in the cold.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0010" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After eating,, I lifted weights. Vince had insisted that become stronger to defend myself. He supplied the dumbells last fall and Dolph coached me on how to use them. After all that wood chopping, and, I guess because I’m young, I could see my progress rack up quickly.</p>
<p>I had taken only a couple of the Aikido classes that Sarah roped me into. After David, she wanted all her girls trained to defend themselves. They were just too far away for me to go regularly.</p>
<p>I climbed into the loft to spend my morning studying. I had subscribed to two magazines: Byte and Dr. Dobb's Journal of Software Tools. From the ads in the back, I found I could mail order technical books, that how I acquired K&R's The C Programming Language; The Art of Computer Programming; Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid; and The Fractal Geometry of Nature. With the new influx of cash from the Iron Horse, I added a shelf of new technical programming books for the long winter: Smalltalk-80; Common Lisp: The Language; APL: A Programming Language; FORTRAN 77 Programming; SQL/Data System; and finally, The Theory of Poker.</p>
<p>That last book was my backup. The reality is that I'm dealing cards for the second time in my life—might be the only career I ever get to have. Practicality—nobody hires programmers from biker bars. Somebody to ought hire me to ride my motorcycle.  I snorted out loud at the thought.</p>
<p>I grabbed the Smalltalk book and propped myself up in the bed in the loft under the USGS topo map of Glacier Park.</p>
<hr>
<p>I heard a motor behind the wind noise. I looked up and tried to focus my hearing. It's a truck, not low enough rumble for a train, certainly not the whine of a snowmobile. It only got louder.</p>
<p>I jumped out of bed and climbed down the ladder to the front room. It definitely labored up my road. I pulled on my parka and boots and opened the door just as a snow plow, headlights mounted up over the blade, pushed into the open area in front of the cabin.</p>
<p>It turned and shoved its bow wave of tumbling slow deftly down the embankment left of my wood shed.</p>
<p>Dolph's F250.</p>
<p>Over the next five minutes, Dolph cleared all the snow drifts off my parking era opening path for my Subaru to easily drive out.</p>
<p>Once he completed the job, he parked and jumped out of the truck. He didn't give any greeting—typical silent Dolph—he just stepped up to me and held out an envelope.</p>
<p>"We got to get going, this weather's bad."</p>
<p>"Going, where are we going?" I looked at him with confusion.</p>
<p>"Open the letter. Vince wants you in Cut Bank."</p>
<p>"Cut Bank? What’s in Cut Bank? I'm surprised they haven’t closed the highway."</p>
<p>"They might, that's why we got to go now."</p>
<p>"C'mon in. Let me read this letter." I turned around and walked back inside without looking to see if Dolph would follow me. He didn't and it felt really weird to just shut the door on him. I stood in the doorway. "You can come in, too."</p>
<p>"We need to get going. Meet me in the truck when you're ready." He then turned and walked back to the truck.</p>
<p>I shut the door and walked to the kitchen. I hadn't been running the generator, so I had only the dim twelve volt battery lights over the propane stove to read by. I opened the envelope and pulled out a folded page enclosing a dozen hundred dollar bills. The page had a brief message in Vince's crude handwriting: "Karl: Cut Bank Auction 2pm - Lot 1984-0688.  Bid up to $1200. You sign for it."</p>
<p>I read it three times trying to understand.</p>
<p>I thought about my book upstairs in the loft—my day derailed. I resented this intrusion into my solitude. Why do I have to be the one to do this?</p>
<p>You're mine now.</p>
<p>I came down to that again. If I'm going to be a club member, I need to do club business when commanded to do so. Heavy sigh.</p>
<p>I stepped back into my bedroom and changed my clothes—need something more presentable. I turned the propane furnace on, setting the thermostat to about fifty. I dampened down the wood stove. I climbed back into the loft, grabbed my day back and put the book into it—climbed back down. In the kitchen, I collected a bag of trail mix, some jerky and the last apple from the grocery store last week. Parka, tuque, gloves—ready.</p>
<p>I stepped back outside ensuring my door actually latched. I pulled off the parka—wouldn't need it inside the truck. I climbed into the passenger side, suffing my parka behind the seat.  Not looking forward to two hours with a silent man.</p>
<p>Dolph nodded to me, putting the truck into gear. We descended the road down to the highway where the wind already had started to fill in his plowing work.</p>
<h2 id="US-2Eastbound">US-2 Eastbound</h2>
<p>The highway had some patches of hardpack snow, but mostly clear. That lasted about half way to Browning where it shifted to mostly bare pavement with periodic ten yard strips of growing drifts on the leeway sides of hills and road cuts.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0039" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After Browning it got much worse. The drifts became deeper and deeper. Dolph knew what to do. He kept the truck in two wheel drive on the dry pavement, and used four wheel drive only on drifts. He mostly just shoved through them, but used the blade to cut into several of them.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0040" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I struggled to recall tho last time I saw an oncoming car—bet the highway was closed.</p>
<p>After carving a path from a particularly deep drift, we encountered a car stopped in the lane just before the next drift—they clearly knew they couldn't get through it. Dolph gave out a heavy sigh.</p>
<p>He stopped behind them, jumped out and approached the car. The driver door opened and he and Dolph talked for a moment, then Dolph gestured to the shoulder side of the drift. The driver nodded and Dolph returned to the truck.</p>
<p>"We're gonna plow him a way to Cut Bank."</p>
<p>Dolph put the truck back in gear, moved around to the shoulder side of the drift and began carving it away. He didn't take it down to bare asphalt, but low enough the car could follow.</p>
<p>Two drifts later, we encountered another car stopped between drifts.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0046" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It took us thirty minutes to get to Cut Bank, where we had a four car convoy behind us. In the long downslope to Cut Bank Creek , we could see a lineup of big rigs behind the Highway Department's road closed sign.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0047" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Shit—we're not gonna get back tonight. I don't even have tooth brush with me.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="GlacierCountyCourthouse">Glacier County Courthouse</h2>
<p><b><span id="U0050" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We pulled into the lot of the county courthouse, I felt my stomach sink—not a commercial auction—a sheriff auction. I dawned on me why Vince sent me here—David’s Harley. As Dolph pulled into to a parking space next another truck with a blade, I dropped my head into my hands and whispered, “Goddamn you, Vince.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0051" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>What the fuck was I going to do if David's there? Bid against him?</p>
<p>Dolph heard me and gave me side eye.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0053" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“I don’t want David’s bike.” Jesus the first time saw that bike, I lusted after both of them—different now. I gotta lose this auction any way I can. Been riding another guy’s bike all summer, Vince wants that permanent.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0054" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Knew you’d feel that.” Dolph looked at me with empathetic eyes. “Vince knows.  Club justice. The fucker owes you.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0055" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"What am I gonna do if he's here?" I shuttered. "I can't face him."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0056" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"You can. You will." He leaned toward me. "I got your back."</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We climbed up the stairs to second floor. Each side of the corridor had its own line of wooden chairs facing outward.. I spotted a couple men sitting next to a door halfway down the hall. One wore a dirty greasy looking cowboy hat, the other, a red tuque. Neither of them were David.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0059" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph was right in allotting so much time before the auction. He managed to get us there just ten minutes before it was to begin.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0060" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We sat in chairs just across from a closed door marked “Conference”. The other guys parked in chairs just to one side.  The door on our side read "Courtroom." Together, we four waited the conference room to open.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0061" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph pulled out his spiral notebook and his pencil and started adding detail to a drawing of a woman I did not recognize. My jaw dropped on seeing the amazing detail of his artwork. Goddamn, he mastered pencil drawing—looked like a black and white photo except for the light blue horizontal rules slicing the woman’s face.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0062" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I watch him draw for several minutes when I heard the conference room door opened for several men to file out. The first three, Blackfeet Tribal Police. The next guy coming out astonished me—mountain man beard, shaggy three or four inches long from way up on his cheeks just under his eyes. He talked animatedly with the guy behind him. They turned down the corridor revealing “DEA” on the back of their coats.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0063" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Four more guys filed out, two more feds and two Glacier County Deputies.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0064" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>After a couple minutes, the County Sheriff stepped out and looked around the hallway looking somewhat startled. "Oh. Didn't expect anybody would show today. Guess we're having an auction after all."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0065" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He looked at the four of us. "You guys can go on in. I'll be back in a few minutes."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0066" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The other guys stood up and walked in as the sheriff headed for the stairs. Dolph and I followed in. I kept scanning the corridor for David, but he wasn't there.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0067" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The room was laid out with a table at one end and a bunch of chairs in rows in the other half of the room. The other guys moved to the far end of the front row and Dolph sat at the near end. I really wanted go sit in the back row. Dolph stopped me with a head gesture to sit next to him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0068" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He flipped a new page over on his notepad and started to rapidly sketch.  Within a few minutes, that bearded DEA agent began to peer at me from the lined paper. Again, I gaped at Dolph's skill.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0069" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"How do you do that? You saw him for two seconds?" It seemed appropriate to whisper.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0070" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The other guys were talking about getting feed to cattle in some south field.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0071" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph shrugged. Then turned to look at me. "Thought you'd like it." He moved to add details to the eyes.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0072" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Enchanted, I watch him draw until the sheriff returned with a pile of papers and sat down at the table at the head of the room.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0073" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>“Figured the weather might keep folks home. Still, you’re here, and that means by law we proceed with the auction. Since it’s just the four of you, let’s make this simple—tell me which lots you intend to bid on, and we’ll save ourselves a long reading.“</p>
<p><b><span id="U0074" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He shifted his gaze to the other two guys. “Dale, you and John want are after that truck, yeah?”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0075" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The older guy with the cowboy hat spoke up. “The F250, not that Datsun tin can.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0076" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The sheriff gave Dale an impatient sigh. “I’m not stupid, Dale.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0077" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He turned to Dolph and me, but addressed Dolph. “I don’t know you gentlemen, what are you bidding on? The Harley or maybe you want the tin can?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0078" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph turned to me, but I stayed silent. He did even wait a second before nudging me hard on the shoulder.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0079" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Again Vince voice whispered in my ear from last summer, “You’re mine now.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0080" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I gave a heavy sigh and spoke. “The Harley.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0081" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The sheriff looked down at his papers and shook his head. “The state's not gonna get what they want today. Gentlemen, by braving the weather, you getting good deals.” He started flipping through his sheets of paper until he found one of the right ones.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0082" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Found the motorcycle, so it’s first up." He read through all the state required preamble and item description out loud. "The bidding starts at five hundred." He looked up at me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0083" style="color: #ffa500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I stayed quiet until Dolph tapped me again. “Five hundred,” I heard myself say, and even to me it sounded low and morose.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0084" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The sheriff lowered an eyebrow and eyed me with that skeptical cop  expression.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0085" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Any other bids?" He paused for only two seconds. "Going once, going twice, sold to the guy that for some reason doesn't seem happy about the deal he just got."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0086" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>He held out a piece of paper. "Take this down to the recorder's office on the ground floor.  Fill it out the paper work. She'll give you the title transfer form to sign and directions on where to pickup the bike."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0087" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I didn't move. Dolph stood up, took the paper, frowning at me.  We walked out as the sheriff started to read the preamble for the sale of David's F250.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0088" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We walked out to the corridor toward the stairs down to the recorders office. We walked down in silence, through the doorway into the recorder's office.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0089" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I handed the lady the sheriff's paper. She read it, nodded and turned away to a filing cabinet. Pulled out some forms brought them back to me and handing me a pen.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0090" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When I finally handed them back to her, she gave me DMV's registration form, stamped with the county seal. "You need to keep this form with the vehicle until the state DMV returns your registration and title." She smiled at me. "You know where the county road shop is?"</p>
<p><b><span id="U0091" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Dolph answered for me. "Yup."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0092" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"They keep bikes inside the maintenance shop. Just hand them this form and you can load the bike up.  You've got ten business days before we start charging a storage fee."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0093" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>She looked over the form I had submitted, then looked at me. “You guys going back to East Glacier?” She shook her head. “Honey, hope you’re not trying t’drive there today. Radio says westbound highway’s closed until tomorrow. Motels gonna fill up fast.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0094" style="color: #d78700;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I nodded and we walked away, donning our winter coats.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0095" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Fifteen minutes later, we stopped at the Cut Bank Creek Motor Lodge. Dolph walked in and got us a room. When he came back to the truck he handed me one of the keys.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0096" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We drove off through the snowy streets to find the county shops.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0097" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We had to wait as there wasn't anyone in the office. The outdoor yard was a hive of activity. Snow plows heading out, others heading in.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0098" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>When we finally got their attention, I handed the paperwork to the clerk and she stamped and kept it. "We'll open the east side garage door and you can back the truck in."</p>
<p><b><span id="U0099" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We returned to the truck and drove around to the east side of the building as the door opened.  Dolph backed as a guy in coveralls and gloves directed him.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0100" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I didn't spot the bike at first, but as soon as I did, I reacted just as I knew I would. Didn't want to even look at it. I felt so bad taking his bike fully aware of the irony—it's not his fault that he's so fucked up. How in the hell am I gonna ride that thing?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0101" style="color: #e99500;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Goddamn, still feeling for the guy that beat me senseless. Is that gonna go on forever?</p>
