            <p>I woke long before dawn, the  Milky Way arched from the eastern horizon—faint, swinging north then descending to the west—bright. The moon hung to my right in the south, only a third of its face lit. To the north, my great bear hung in the sky watching over me.</p>
<p>Warm and comfortable in my sleeping bag, I waited for the zodiacal light. Not really prominent this time of the year, I didn’t bank on seeing it. One at a time, the three stars of Orion’s Belt rose from under the horizon. First time I’d ever seen Orion in the summer.</p>
<p>A half hour later, I got the nut flush I hoped for: the Zodiacal Light. The faint triangle of light, just a few degrees north of due east, appeared in the sky. Not really very visible looking directly, I caught it only by side-eyeing the horizon.  It's really a fall or spring phenomenon, never strong in the mid-summer.</p>
<p>Another half hour later, at the first stab of sunlight hit the tallest peaks  Glacier Park. Every few moments another mountain would light up. They all caught it before I did, my peak stood a thousand feet shorter.</p>
<p>The closest park peak now lit was, of course, the wall of Calf Robe. I remembered standing on top of it, looking south to this very peak. I didn't know its name until I had gotten home and located it on the topo maps in my loft.</p>
<p>I nestled back down into my sleeping bag. Probably below freezing out there. Over the years of climbing to peaks, I'd noticed that dawn always kick starts the winds. I wanted a few minutes longer in the warmth I had banked through the night.</p>
<p>Didn't mean to, but I slipped back to sleep. From the angle of the sun, about fifteen degrees off the horizon, I figured I had slept another hour.</p>
<p>I pulled my backpack closer, digging into one of the pockets for my bag of granola trail mix. Once I got my water bottle opened and I downed half of it, I realized how strongly I needed to pee.</p>
<p>While I was naked in the sleeping bag, I learned long ago that sleeping with my clothes stashed in with me meant putting on warm clothes instead cold ones. I struggled a bit, but I got myself dressed before I climbed out the sleeping bag into the cold air.</p>
<p>Standing on the highest boulder of the peak and unzipping the pants that I had zipped up only seconds earlier, I arced a pee stream out over the edge. I watched it spatter onto that rocky chute that I had considered climbing yesterday. My stream undermined a fist sized rock. It tumbled, gathered a cohort of companion pebbles and sailed over the headwall to the cirque below. Had I tried to climb it, that would have been me plummeting down the cliff.</p>
<p>I needed to get out of the wind.  With my grip firmly on the rope, lowered pack back down the cleft I had climbed yesterday. Once sitting on the ground, I let the rope drop.</p>
<p>There was alway a moment when leaving a mountain peak, a tiny electrostatic shock of disappointment. Most peaks are one time experiences, there were always more of them, few would ever see my return.</p>
<p>Bracing my legs on the far boulder, I chimneyed down between the twin rocks, reversing yesterday's moves. The pika sitting on rock near my pack had only harsh words for me regarding my trespass: a series of high pitched barks of alarm as it eyed me. I flashed an open palm to it and it vanished behind its rock. Just two seconds later, from a rock six feet above me, it restated its objections in no uncertain terms.</p>
<p>With the rope recoiled and lashed to the pack, I hefted it onto my shoulders and left the pika in peace.</p>
<p>My entire route laid in front of me. I wasn't retracing my path from yesterday. I was going straight over to the ridge and down into Hyde Creek Canyon. I would follow it all the way down to the Two Medicine River, then climb back up to check out what the fuck those bulldozers were doing.</p>
<p>An hour later, Hyde Creek canyon astounded me. From my vantage point on a rock outcrop, I could see about a mile and a half of its course. Rank after rank of white water rapids, still looking formidable even though we were a couple months beyond the highest of the season snowmelt. No way I could hike the canyon floor, best stay on the ridge and then drop to the confluence with the river.</p>
<p>I took the opportunity to sit with my backpack's weight sitting on the rock behind me. I fished in my pocket for the plastic bag and my lighter. I pulled out the second to the last joint and smiled: totally sweet spot for a mid morning toke over the canyon.</p>
<p>The first draw tasted foul, like I'd just lit a literal roach.  I spit to try to get the taste out of my mouth. I examined the joint, it had gone out. No insect. I tapped the ash off of it and pinched the end back to unburned leaf.</p>
<p>The lighter made its click, spark, and tiny whoosh as I pulled in another lungful—explosive coughing. The thing was totally wrong. Coughed so hard I got dizzy.</p>
<p>I tore the joint open. White stuff all over the leaf. Moldy? I just sucked a moldy joint.</p>
<p>The bottom dropped out of my mind.</p>
