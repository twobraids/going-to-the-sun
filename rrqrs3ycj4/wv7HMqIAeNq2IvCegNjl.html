            </div>
                  
            <p>I woke long before dawn, the  Milky Way arched from the eastern horizon—faint, swinging north then descending to the west—bright. The moon hung to my right in the south, only a third of its face lit. To the north, my great bear hung in the sky watching over me.</p>
<p>Warm and comfortable in my sleeping bag, I waited for the zodiacal light. Not really prominent this time of the year, I didn’t bank on seeing it. One at a time, the three stars of Orion’s Belt rose from under the horizon. First time I’d ever seen Orion in the summer.</p>
<p>A half hour later, I got the nut flush I hoped for: the Zodiacal Light. The faint triangle of light, just a few degrees north of due east, appeared in the sky. Not really very visible looking directly, I caught it only by side-eyeing the horizon.  It's really a fall or spring phenomenon, never strong in the mid-summer.</p>
<p>Another half hour later, at the first stab of sunlight hit the tallest peaks  Glacier Park. Every few moments another mountain would light up. They all caught it before I did, my peak stood a thousand feet shorter.</p>
<p>The closest park peak now lit was, of course, the wall of Calf Robe. I remembered standing on top of it, looking south to this very peak. I didn't know its name until I had gotten home and located it on the topo maps in my loft.</p>
<p>I nestled back down into my sleeping bag. Probably below freezing out there. Over the years of climbing to peaks, I'd noticed that dawn always kick starts the winds. I wanted a few minutes longer in the warmth I had banked through the night.</p>
<p>Didn't mean to, but I slipped back to sleep. From the angle of the sun, about fifteen degrees off the horizon, I figured I had slept another hour.</p>
<p>I pulled my backpack closer, digging into one of the pockets for my bag of granola trail mix. Once I got my water bottle opened and I downed half of it, I realized how strongly I needed to pee.</p>
<p>While I was naked in the sleeping bag, I learned long ago that sleeping with my clothes stashed in with me meant putting on warm clothes instead cold ones. I struggled a bit, but I got myself dressed before I climbed out the sleeping bag into the cold air.</p>
<p>Standing on the highest boulder of the peak and unzipping the pants that I had zipped up only seconds earlier, I arced a pee stream out over the edge. I watched it spatter onto that rocky chute that I had considered climbing yesterday. My stream undermined a fist sized rock. It tumbled, gathered a cohort of companion pebbles and sailed over the headwall to the cirque below. Had I tried to climb it, that would have been me plummeting down the cliff.</p>
<p>I needed to get out of the wind.  With my grip firmly on the rope, lowered pack back down the cleft I had climbed yesterday. Once sitting on the ground, I let the rope drop.</p>
<p>There was alway a moment when leaving a mountain peak, a tiny electrostatic shock of disappointment. Most peaks are one time experiences, there were always more of them, few would ever see my return.</p>
<p>Bracing my legs on the far boulder, I chimneyed down between the twin rocks, reversing yesterday's moves. The pika sitting on rock near my pack had only harsh words for me regarding my trespass: a series of high pitched barks of alarm as it eyed me. I flashed an open palm to it and it vanished behind its rock. Just two seconds later, from a rock six feet above me, it restated its objections in no uncertain terms.</p>
<p>With the rope recoiled and lashed to the pack, I hefted it onto my shoulders and left the pika in peace.</p>
<p>My entire route laid in front of me. I wasn't retracing my path from yesterday. I was going straight over to the ridge and down into Hyde Creek Canyon. I would follow it all the way down to the Two Medicine River, then climb back up to check out what the fuck those bulldozers were doing.</p>
<p>An hour later, Hyde Creek canyon astounded me. From my vantage point on a rock outcrop, I could see about a mile and a half of its course. Rank after rank of white water rapids, still looking formidable even though we were a couple months beyond the highest of the season snowmelt. No way I could hike the canyon floor, best stay on the ridge and then drop to the confluence with the river.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0016" style="color: #6e4c00;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I took the opportunity to sit with my backpack's weight resting on the rock behind me. I fished in my pocket for the plastic bag and my lighter. I pulled out the second to the last joint and smiled: totally sweet spot for a mid morning toke over the canyon.</p>
<p>The first draw tasted foul, like I'd just lit a literal roach.  I spit to try to get the taste out of my mouth. I examined the joint, it had gone out. No insect. I tapped the ash off of it and pinched the end back to unburned leaf.</p>
<p>The lighter made its click, spark, and tiny whoosh as I pulled in another lungful—explosive coughing. The thing was totally wrong. Coughed so hard I got dizzy.</p>
<p>I tore the joint open fearing maggots. White stuff all over the weed. Moldy? I just sucked a moldy joint.</p>
<p>The bottom dropped out of my mind.</p>

<p>Stood up. Out of balance. Pitched over backwards. Weight on my back. Grizzly bear! Rolling. Struggling. Fighting.</p>

<p>No! David. Trying to fuck. Rolled again. Pleaded, no words. No words. Never had words.</p>

<p>Had to push. No head. No arms. Shoved over the edge. Tumbled and rolled. Disappeared under whitewater.</p>
<p>Run. Save him. Falling. So far away. Miles and miles. Waves in the ground. Swinging a circle in circles. Up and down. Tilt-a-whirl. Laughing and laughing.</p>
<p>Ground. Dirt. Grass. Fractal. Leaves. Red tops. Red, red, red. Wildflowers. Paint brush. No bitterroots. Bitter, bastard, roots.</p>
<p>Carnie. Dealing cards for Carnie. Make him proud.</p>

<p>Water had no sound. Tried walking on it. Didn’t work. Looked up from underwater. Weird looking at myself looking back up. Laughing.  Nobody here.</p>

<hr>
<p>I shivered and rolled over. Crap poking into my back. It hurt. Opened my eyes, still dark. Blind?</p>
<p>Panic. Groping around on the ground for my tent. Why am I not in my tent? Nothing but pine needles, broken twigs and pine cones.</p>
<p>Stopped. Deep shivering breaths in the cold. I looked to the sky and saw stars. One dimensional relief. I can see.</p>
<p>Dosed with angel dust. Grizz did that. The Ghosts did that.</p>
<p>Where the hell am I?</p>
<p>Got no shirt on. Need to get warm.  I stood up, directly into overhead branches. I ducked down to get away from the trunk. Trees seemed pretty dense, typical lodgepole pine.</p>
<p>Glad to realize I still had my pants and boots on. Where's my pack?</p>
<p>Need to move around to make heat. On my first step, something in my pocket jammed me hard in the crotch. Hand to pocket, I found a long candle about and inch in diameter, but too heavy for a candle. No wick, a cap at one end, felt plastic. Waxed cardboard tube.</p>
<p>No idea where it came from.</p>
<p>I sniffed it: chemical, like those wax logs they sell in the grocery stores. Then realized that both my hands had already smelled the same.</p>
<p>Red. The memory of a blinding red light moving at the end of my hand.</p>
<p>A flare?</p>
<p>The fire up the hillside. That concussion. Laughing at the blast. Dream?  Memory? A dragon, what the fuck?</p>
<p>The flare could let me see and find my pack. Got a flashlight in there. A flare would also set the forest on fire. Need to find a rocky place to make a fire. Need to get warm.</p>
<p>Started to run in place to generate heat. That just made my head ache.</p>
<p>I chose to blunder uphill, then find my shit when dawn comes. After what seemed like ten minutes, and three head hits to low branches, I came upon the base of a rock outcrop. To the right the edge, I skirted around trees and stepped out of the forest into the open.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0056" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The stars and the sweep of the Milky Way gave me orientation. I spun to spot the North Star, behind me, upslope. That meant I faced west. I shook my head. No, that meant I faced south. Jesus, my mind was fucked up.</p>
<p>The feeble light of the partial moon afforded me enough light to clear a patch of ground and grope for rocks to pile in a circle. Then back to the trees to gather small branches.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0058" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Felt like an hour to figure out how to light the flare.  The seriously red light nearly blinded me. No dream. I had done this before, but no idea of where or when.</p>
<p>Using a flare to start my campfire was complete overkill, but its the only tool I had.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0060" style="color: #4d3800;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I spent the rest of the night feeding my fire to stay warm. Had to keep turning my body around to heat all sides. Thinking about that night at my fire ring with Chris and Vince, before they turned into Snake and Carnie.</p>
<p>I let the tears come.</p>
