            <p>I woke long before dawn, the the Milky Way arched form the eastern horizon—faint, swinging north then descending to the west—bright. The moon hung to my right in the south, only a third of its face lit. To the north, my great bear hung in the sky watching over me.</p>
<p>Warm and comfortable in my sleeping bag, I waited for the zodiacal light. Not really prominent this time of the year, I didn’t bank on seeing it. One at a time, the three stars of Orion’s Belt rose from behind the horizon. First time I’d ever seen Orion in the summer.</p>
<p>A half hour later, I got the nut flush I hoped for: the Zodiacal Light. The faint triangle of light, just a few degrees north of the due east, rose slowly into the sky, not really very visible  looking directly at it. I caught it only by side-eying the horizon. It's really a fall or spring phenomenon, it was never strong in the mid-summer.</p>
<p>Another half hour later, the moment that first stab of sunlight, I looked north to the peaks of Glacier Park. They had caught the light before I did, my peak a thousand feet shorter than them.</p>
<p>The closest park peak was, of course, Calf Robe. I remembered looking south to this very peak. I didn't know its name until I had gotten home and located it on the topo maps above my bed.</p>
<p>I nestled back down into my sleeping bag. Probably below freezing out there. Over the years of climbing to peaks, I'd noticed that dawn always kick starts the breezes. I wanted a few minutes longer in the warmth I had saved through the night.</p>
<p>Didn't mean to, but I slipped back to sleep. From the angle of the sun, about fifteen degrees, I figured I had slept another hour.</p>
<p>I pulled my backpack closer, digging into one of the pockets for my bag of granola trail mix. Once I got my water bottle opened and I downed half of it, I realized how strongly I needed to pee.</p>
<p>While I was naked in the sleeping bag, I learned long ago that sleeping with my clothes left in the bag with me meant putting on warm clothes instead cold ones. I struggled a bit, but I got myself dressed before I climbed out into the cold air.</p>
<p>Stepping up to the highest rock of the peak, while unzipping the pants that I had zipped up only seconds earlier, I arched my pee stream out over the edge. I watched it spatter into that rocky chute that I had actually considered climbing yesterday. That would have been death.</p>
<p>I needed to get out of the wind. I secured my pack and, with the rope, I lowered to down the cleft I had climbed yesterday. Once it was down, I let the rope drop and it free fell to the bottom.</p>
<p>There was alway a moment when leaving a mountain peak, a tiny electrostatic shock of disappointment. Most peaks are one time experiences, while there were always more of them, few would ever see me return.</p>
<p>I chimneyed down, reversing my moves from yesterday. The pika, sitting on rock near my pack had only harsh words for me. A series of high pitched barks of alarm as it eyed me. I flashed an open palm to it and it vanished behind its rock. Just two seconds later, from a rock a few feet above me, it restated its objections in no uncertain terms.</p>
<p>With the rope recoiled and lashed to the pack, I hefted it onto my shoulders and left the pika in peace.</p>
<p>I could see almost my entire route laid in front of me. I wasn't retracing my path from yesterday, I was going straight over to the ridge this side of Hyde Creek. I would follow it all the way down to the Two Medicine River, then climb back up to checkout what those bulldozers were doing.</p>
