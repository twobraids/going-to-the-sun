            <p><b><span id="U0000" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Sitting in the passenger seat of my own bike seemed really weird. I placed my hands on either side of Carnie as he pulled out of the Loop parking space. He accelerated quickly to stay in front of the a troupe of slow moving cars of tourist families.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0001" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>First time in my life I had ever been a passenger on a motorcycle. It had to be this way. I'd never ridden with a passenger. Carnie out weighed me way too much for me to safely handle the controls. My job, like all motorcycle passengers, pretend to be a sack of potatoes: no movement, do nothing to upset the balance.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0002" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>The plan hinged on us leaving his bike at the Loop parking area and then riding up to the Logan Pass Visitor Center together on my bike. We'd use that as our trail head for the Garden Wall hike and the view of Grinnell Glacier. Late this afternoon, we'd arrive back down on the loop on foot.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0003" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I'd be passenger a second time, this time on his bike. We'd pick up mine and then head on to my cabin.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0004" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I don't think I was a very good passenger. Not seeing past him drove me nuts. Yeah, the back seat is a bit higher than the riding seat, but couldn't see over his shoulder.  Each time I reflexively tried to see ahead by leaning, I'd feel him having to counter my lean and he'd bark at me.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0005" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Not ideal. I eventually gave up and just kept my head pointed to the right. The reward came fast. Never had the chance to see Bird Woman Falls across the Logan Valley. Nearly six hundred vertical foot drop, a twisted white ribbon marking the drop from the hanging valley of west of Mount Oberlin. Not flowing like it would have been a month ago, but still a great sight without having to watch the road instead.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0006" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Carnie took the curves more slowly than I would have on my own.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0007" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Forty minutes later, Carnie pulled into a parking space at the Logan Pass Visitor Center. Same place where I climbed the snow bank with David, and the Japanese tourists took camera liberties to remember real American Bikers.</p>
<p>Full sun, but a cold wind arced up over the west ridge and dove down into the St Mary Valley. No gusts, just a smooth constant breeze, enough to make a dropped bandana into a chase.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0009" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>I switched to my hiking boots, Carnie opted to stick with his bike boots. That raised heel and heavy sole would have crippled me in a mile. Tossed him a skeptical look.</p>
<p>We followed the Ledge Trail where Chris had refused to go and then on down the path that hugged the steep slopes of what the tour guides call the Garden Wall. Accurate name, acres of a wild flower riot, tipped nearly vertical. No way to hike straight up hill, the narrow trail wouldn't be wide enough to stop a misstep's plummet.</p>
<p>Not always that dramatic, the trail trended downward, crossing ridges and meadows crowded with flowers. The colors followed the elevations and the sunlight. Open windswept gravel sprouted whites, blues and pinks on top of tight pincushion foliage. Several species of yellow flowers claim the more level open slopes. The moist places by the snow fields had their own communities and colors.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0013" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>It took several hours to get the Grinnell Glacier cut off. The switch from a constantly descending trail to a steep pitch upward felt as both a relief and an unwelcome burden.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0014" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We didn't have this trail to ourselves. I could see a group of three several hundred yards ahead of us and I knew of more behind.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0015" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Carnie didn't have the aerobic endurance that I had from my constant hiking. We had to take several breaks for him to catch his breath.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0017" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Twenty minutes later, we met the group ahead on their return trip back down. The two women excitedly recounted the incredible view in store for us ahead. I just smiled, having been there many times, I knew what we'd see.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0018" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Carnies reaction as we crested the top of the pass made me grin.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0019" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>"Holy shit!" Carnie stopped in his tracks. "Holy fucking shit!" He took a few halting steps forward, then turned abruptly halfway, facing the knife edged ridge to the east. He looked alternately between the Logan drainage to the right and Grinnell drainage to the left. "This mountain's only twenty feet thick here."</p>
<p>I stepped up behind him taking in the view—literally breathtaking as I waited to catch my breath from the ascent. I start naming the glaciers and mountain peaks out loud. I had laid in the loft of my cabin under the USGS topo maps for two years memorizing these names.</p>
<p><b><span id="U0021" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Carnie caught me with a full body hug. “Thank you, for pushing me here, didn't think I'd make it. Holy shit, I had no idea.” He pulled back and looked me in the eye with a shit eating grin. “I’m gonna remember this forever. Thank you, Acid.”</p>
<p><b><span id="U0022" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>Acid? What the fuck—he didn't realize what said. He just stood there with that delighted child look on his smiling face as my grin flatlined. Was I always going to be someone else to him?</p>
<p><b><span id="U0023" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We lingered on the ridge top for twenty minutes before we started the two hour hike back down to the Loop.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><span id="U0025" style="color: #443300;">&#x25CF;</span></b>We had dinner together at the restaurant in the East Glacier Lodge, bison steaks.</p>
