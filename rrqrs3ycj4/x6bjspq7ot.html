            <p>4Vince and I pulled our bikes into a single parking space at the Logan Pass Visitor Center. Same place where I climbed the snow bank with David, and the Japanese tourists took camera liberties to remember real American Bikers.</p>
<p>Full sun, but a cold wind arced up over the west ridge and dove down into the St Mary Valley. No gusts, just a smooth constant breeze, enough to make a dropped bandana into a chase.</p>
<p>I switched to my hiking boots, Vince opted to stick with his bike boots. Tossed him a skeptical look. That raised heel and heavy sole would have crippled me in a mile.</p>
<p>We followed the Ledge Trail where Chris had refused to go and then on down the path that hugged the steep slopes of what the tour guides call the Garden Wall. Accurate name, acres of a wild flower riot, tipped nearly vertical. No way to hike straight up hill, the narrow trail wouldn't be wide enough to stop a misstep's plummet.</p>
<p>Not always that dramatic, the trail trended downward, crossing ridges and meadows crowded with flowers. The colors followed the elevations and the sunlight. Open windswept gravel sprouted whites, blues and pinks on top of tight pincushion foliage. Several species of yellow flowers claim the more level open slopes. The moist places by the snow fields had their own communities and colors.</p>
<hr>
<p>"Holy shit!" Vince stopped in his tracks. "Holy fucking shit!" He took a few halting steps forward, then turned abruptly halfway, facing the knife edged ridge to the east. He looked alternately between the MacDonald drainage to the right and Grinnell drainage to the left. "This mountain's only twenty feet thick here."</p>
<p>I stepped up behind him taking in the view—literally breathtaking as I waited to catch my breath from the ascent. I start naming the glaciers and mountain peaks out loud. I had laid in the loft of my cabin under the USGS topo maps for two years memorizing these names.</p>
<p>Vince caught me with a full body hug. “Thank you, for pushing me here, didn't think I'd make it. Holy shit, I had no idea.” He pulled back and looked me in the eye with a shit eating grin. “I’m gonna remember this forever. Thank you, Acid.”</p>
<p>Acid? What the fuck—he didn't realize what said. He just stood there with that delighted child look on his smiling face.</p>
