            <p>"Holy shit!" Vince stopped in his tracks. "Holy fucking shit!" He took a few halting steps forward, then turned abruptly halfway, facing the knife edged ridge to the east. He looked alternately between the MacDonald drainage to the right and Grinnell drainage to the left. "This mountain's only twenty feet thick here."</p>
<p>I stepped up behind him taking in the view—literally breathtaking as I waited to catch my breath from the ascent. I start naming the glaciers and mountain peaks out loud. I had laid in the loft of my cabin under the USGS topo maps for two years memorizing these names.</p>
<p>Vince caught me with a full body hug. “Thank you, for pushing me here, didn't think I'd make it. Holy shit, I had no idea.” He pulled back and looked me in the eye with a shit eating grin. “I’m gonna remember this forever. Thank you, Acid.”</p>
<p>Acid? What the fuck—he didn't realize what said. He just stood there with that delighted child look on his face smiling at me.</p>
